""From the dress to the kanji, to the religion, to the architecture, almost everything in Japanese culture was an imitation of the golden age Han dynasty.""

I'm well aware that they imported China's alphabet; Japanese refer to these characters as ""kanji"".

6,1709525210.0,Would the Shogun FX show be better if they just completely portray the real history behind Tokugawa Ieyasu instead of Clavell's overly dramatic and ridiculous Shogun novel?,"Why I find the novel overly ridiculous and unnecessary compared as to the real history which is much better

1. Samurai committing hara-kiri became a normal gesture. ""Oh hey I screamed at you, I'll committ hara-kiri and off my child too to end my bloodline"". Samurai from what I read isn't that stupid and hara-kiri or seppuku were only a means to an end where they only have a choice on dying by public execution or lifetime imprisonment. They don't necessarily throw themselves off a cliff and they're not that stupid.

They even condemn it at times as they deemed it unnecessary.

2. They made Tokugawa Ieyasu (Yoshii Toronaga) look like a good guy. He's never the good guy, neither was he the bad guy. He was an overly abused Samurai politician who's fighting back against all odds and clearly he views that by seizing power, he could secure his survival and at the same time, having revenge and power over his adversaries.

Ieyasu from what I read was a calm, laid back yet didn't have the aura of a good guy. He was more of a strategical thinker with a little bit of sinister vibes although we get more of that with Oda Nobunaga.

3. The love story between Will Adams (John Blackthorne) and Hosokawa Gracia/Akechi Tama (Mariko Toda) is unnecessary as she was the daughter of Akechi Mitsuhide who killed Oda Nobunaga and their family name pretty much received infamy from the public. That alone is much better than Mariko.

Another thing is that Adams and Gracia never actually met. And she is much loyal to her husband as Adams to his wife before he knew he'll never be allowed to leave Japan who even wrote letters to his wife.

Gracia's impact is actually a contradiction between the Samurai culture of suicide and that of her newfound belief in Christianity.

For me, that Shogun novel by Clavell just ruined the real Japanese history instead of educating and making things better.",AskHistorians

9,1709523093.0,How organized were the migration of Cham communities between Champa and states in Nusantara?,"To start off with, I'm someone of Cham descent and growing up a lot of my understanding of Cham history was through oral tradition within my family. My family has narrated to me that our ancestors were lords (Po) from what is now Hoi An in Vietnam and that the king in Hoi An tasked my family, the Ph·ª•ng (È≥≥) clan, to lead a population of Cham to settle in Kelantan after the northern lands of Champa were conquered by Dai Viet. My family also stated that the king ordered this migration so that Cham communities abroad could grow and eventually migrate back to Champa to fight against the Vietnamese. My own family was said to have settled in Kelantan for an unspecified amount of generations before returning to Champa and continue serving in the royal army. My family also said there were other noble families that led populations abroad to other regions in Malaysia (Malacca was named as one of the cities), Indonesia, Hainan, and even Laos.

My question ultimately is, how organized were these migrations really? And is my family's oral history accurate at all in portraying the migrations of the Cham both abroad and returning?

22,1709513364.0,Is the narrative that Christianity is peculiarly opposed to slavery basically a product of the abolitionist movement?,"This is slightly inspired by [this recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1b30n51/why_is_medieval_slavery_so_often_forgotten_in_the/.) about medieval slavery as well as others.

It is often asserted in popular culture and by less-academic historical authors like Tom Holland that Christianity's emphasis on universal redemption and the like makes it particularly hostile to slavery. Christianity, both in Roman times and later, is often also framed as have a particular appeal to slaves (and other oppressed groups like women.)

Am I right in thinking this is possibly a result of the abolitionist movement of the 1800s religious overtones? The abolitionists heavily relied on the language of the Bible to make their case. Obviously this gets into the weeds of circular reasoning, did they read the Bible that way because they dislikes slavery or did the Bible make them dislike slavery (or both.)

But, generally speaking, while there were individual Christian philosophers opposed to the practice, general opposition to slavery seems fairly minor up until the colonial era. Slavery was also a fundamental part of the world that the many authors of the Bible were raised in, and by and large it does not seem to have phased them.

When slavery declined prior to the colonial era, it seems to have mostly been for economic or legal shifts rather than moral ones.",AskHistorians

To be fair to Francisco Xim√©nez, this was a completely different time period and place than 12th-13th century Iceland, so maybe there was a better effort in conserving it ""properly"". Also, as far as I understand, the ""conquest"" of a lot of Central America took a very long time to happen, so these legends might still have been very much alive when the Popol Vuh was written.

Reading up on Sub-Saharan African history, I've found that, even though there are African civilizations older than the West and that had access to written language, they didn't write a lot on their history, it seems. Their writings, from what I get, are mostly about religion, law/administration and royal monuments. There are intellectual works and, yes, histories, but my point is they didn't write enough for us to tell their histories in such a meticulous, detailed way as we can on other societies.

Africa isn't alone. Take Ancient Persia. I don't know of any Achaemenid chronicle like the ones about Mesopotamian states. I mean, these mfs founded the world's greatest empire so far and were FORGOTTEN by Iranians. Historical writing in Iran appears to begin in the Middle Ages.

Same with the Indian subcontinent. They have one of the world's oldest literatures and wrote about religion, philosophy, math, even goddam linguistics and sex, but the only pre-medieval historical-like books I could find are poems about the deeds of kings.

I don't know much about Southeast Asia but I take they have similar trajectories, since I know the great empires of Angkor and Srivijaya didn't leave any records (Srivijaya was also forgotten).

""But what about Egypt and the Ancient Near East?"", you say. These societies did write about their history, but, according to Wikipedia, these were succint, different from the ones in Greece. 

I'm not saying all these peoples were disinterested in their pasts. I know in West Africa, for instance, griots were/are the responsibles to pass down the lore of important families, similar to Irish medieval bards.

Factually, once Reagan was sworn in, the hostages were released only minutes after. 


The iran hostage situation was one of the most important factors of the 79 election and many Carter people say it was an October surprise situation and Reagan paid them off. 

The government of course investigated this (themselves) and found that the accusations were not credible. However, apparently a lot of evidence the last couple of decades have added credibility to it.

79,1709484358.0,Any book recommendations on Kievan/Muscovite Russia?,"To put any knee-jerk reactions to bed, I have already looked at the Book List. Barring one book, they were all talking about the Revolution & Soviet Russia. Interesting, to be sure, but not what I'm looking for lol

I am trying to learn as much as I can about Kievan Rus', Muscovite Russia, and the Tsardom of Russia. I won't lie to you good people, my interest in these periods of Russia's history stems from the clothing--the women's clothing, in particular. However, I am not *primarily* interested in books on pre-Westernized fashion (although I certainly will not turn down a recommendation that talks about it!). I want to understand as much as I can: the religion, the politics, the military, the social conventions, everything. There are absolutely areas I am much more interested in (the social & cultural aspects), but nevertheless, I want to try to understand the time as well as I possibly can! I have a pretty solid understanding of the Middle Ages as a whole, and I do know quite a bit about the periods I mentioned, so feel free to recommend more ""advanced"" reading material.

I am *extremely* interested in the terem, or the seclusion of elite women. To my understanding, this began in Muscovite Russia during the 16th century and ended in the 18th century with Peter the Great (forever crying tears of blood he banned traditional clothing from the court. Peter the Great, you are my enemy). I know the seclusion of elite women means there is precious little about women during this time, but that only makes me more interested. I concede I am always very interested in what women of the time were doing, so this interest is not borne solely out of curiosity for the terem, but it only makes me itch all the more to learn about them.

I already have a few books on my phone, but I hate reading on my phone, so I greatly prefer *real* books. Unfortunately, my library has only one of them, thus I require more recommendations (read: I am greedy for knowledge and there are never too many books to consume whole). Obviously, there is no guarantee my library will have any of the recs you may provide, but hopefully the Consortium will have a few.

The books I have are (and forgive that I don't know the proper way to format): *Medieval Russia: A Source Book, 850-1700* by Basil Dmytryshyn; *Medieval Russia 980-1584, Second Edition* by Janet Martin; *Portraits of Medieval Eastern Europe 900-1400* by Donald Ostrowski & Christian Raffensperger; *Portraits of Old Russia: Imagined Lives of Ordinary People, 1300-1725* by
Donald Ostrowski & Marshall T. Poe; *Russia and the Russians: A History, Second Edition* by  Geoffrey Hosking (this is the one my library has); and *Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century* by Natalia Pushkareva trans. Eve Levin

In many cases, sculptures are not even reassembled when it appears we do have all or most of the broken parts, but just have all the broken parts displayed next to each other.

This seems like distinct rejection from the earlier way of doing things. Personally I would rather see, e.g, an ancient bust with a modern nose than one with no nose at all. Even if we can't know how accurate the modern nose is, it's pretty clear the original wasn't intended to be displayed without a nose.

Bill hamilton, the founder of inslaw that created the PROMIS software claims the us government withheld payments to him which forced bankruptcy on his company. He claims The US government then took the source code and started selling it to foreign governments with a back door to spy on their computers. The PROMIS software was a powerful law enforcement software so the US had direct access to the records of foreign country law enforcement.


Ghislaine maxwells father Robert Maxwell was famously a double spy for Israel and sold the PROMIS software allegedly. Famously the journalist, Danny casalado, who was on the verge of breaking the story ‚Äúcommitted suicide‚Äù and repeatedly said that if he died it wasn‚Äôt an accident. 

Various documentaries, books and blogs have written about it. The conspiracy goes much deeper and is related to iran contra / cia drug smuggling / the GOP higher ups. I won‚Äôt go into it but my fundamental question is:

1) did the PROMIS software truly have a back door for the US to access ? It‚Äôs objectively true that the PROMIS software was sold to foreign countries.

2) did the US sell the software with the intent to spy on our neighbors ?

3) what is the consensus of who killed danny casalaro or was it himself ?

4) according to Michael riconoscioutu, Earl Brian was a higher up in the Reagan administration who paid Iran $40M to hold on to the hostages and release them the second Reagen was elected. Reagan won the election and earl brian felt Ronald owed him. Brian wanted the PROMIS software which is why the US DOJ did all it could to get it. Michael allegedly worked on the software to install the back door. Michael worked with/knew an fbi hitman who killed Michael‚Äôs best friend and others in order for the cia to control the drug trade.

Considering that the Soviet Union lost something like 17 million people, why is that not classified as a genocide? I understand that many casualties were from the war itself and historians might be a bit wary about classifying war as genocide and would like to keep these topics separate, however, one must consider that Hitler started this war with explicit intent to destroy Slavic and other Soviet people, he wanted them enslaved and dead. It‚Äôs also important to note that something like 3 million POWs died in concentration camps and numerous many atrocities were committed against civilian populations. Surely if the bar here is Srebrenica, which was considered an act of genocide and Bosnian genocide at large, then this is much worse

There was very much a special intent to destroy the Soviets and Slavs and he succeeded in destroying this group at least in part.

Was there a phase of war-like politics that came before the actual war? Is there a pattern of legislative conflict that precedes civil wars in general, in history?

For the sake of this question, let us assume that ""war-like"" politics means politicians who are elected and/or supported by their voters for harming the other perceived political side as an end in itself, rather than to advance any specific policy objectives for the country as a whole. To some extent this must exist in all politics, but it would be noteworthy if this trend sharpens before civil wars happen, as though the will towards cultural conflict expresses itself at times first through elections and legislation then later through diplomacy by other means

Alamariu states that philosophy is an attempt by a city's aristocratic elite in decline to try to safeguard their morals and values that guided their life. He suggests that all cities that existed before philosophy were highly egalitarian and superstitious societies that were completely under the thrall of custom and tradition. These customs and traditions suppress people with ambition and energy from manifesting their potential, and the only way to break this system is an invasion (usually by a nomadic class of warriors) and establishment of outsiders as rulers and aristocrats of the city. The city then exists as a hierarchy where the aristocrats preserve their mores and values through selective breeding. Over time, the two populations become more and more merged and the elite start to decline, causing the city to regress back to its old egalitarian, superstitious self. Philosophy, therefore takes birth in order to use reason to protect those values that were taken for granted and considered naturally right by the aristocrats at the beginning of their rule.

We are very comfortable attributing the outcome of events to random chance or black swans instead of fitting everything into a divined plan. We certainly don't presume knowledge of the future beyond making reasoned predictions. 

However, a recurring theme in Greek myth, especially in tragedy, is the futility of trying to escape one's predetermined fate. Its prominence in Hellenistic culture seems to indicate that following one's allotted path in life occupied an important position in the Greek collective consciousness. This concept requires not only complete conviction that you have a destiny and fit into a divine plan but also that you believe that you have foreknowledge of your own life available to you, to even be capable of making the choice of whether to follow said plan or not.

How did this idea translate to the life of an average citizen? Did their conception of their own fate come mostly from oracles/divination, from the effect larger cultural forces had on their lives, or was it something else entirely? 

As an aside, it seems like this kind of worldview would be naturally resistant to purposeless and nihilistic attitudes.

I want to be as authentic as possible wherever I can be, so I'm trying to figure out the best sources for that period, especially primary sources. I've found the Dresden Codex, but as far as I can tell it is scant on details about daily life. I understand that, unfortunately, there aren't likely many primary sources remaining after contact with Europeans.

When you look at a map that shows allied Vs axis area of control, what's happening on the ground? (I'm thinking mostly of the European theatre here, as I imagine the mechanics are very different in, say, jungle fighting in the Pacific)

I assume there isn't a single unbroken front like in WW1 western Europe. But would there be a line of mutually supporting positions? Or would the holding army just be controlling the major lines of communication (roads/railways etc.) If the latter, what would stop an attacker sending a force ""cross country"" to bypass those?

Or am I taking 'line"" too literally and actually theres no clear line where one sides troops ""cannot pass"", and maybe the areas of control on a map are more like where one side would be able to rapidly and forcefully challenge an advance if it occurred?

 
I especially struggle to visualise how this works in the context of rapid armour movement. There's lots of examples where tanks are described as 'punching' through lines of a salient and then encircling the enemy troops within.

Now my wife has found her way back to the catholic faith and thus the church. She has spent extensive time finding answers to questions and preconceived notions she had about the church and has come up with a point of view that quite contradicts many things we both held as settled.  
While I trust her to still sanity check her sources, the truth of the matter is that any information that isn't completely against the institution/organization seems to come from within that organization and any outside source seems to be biased against it.  
So I have a list of points of contention where I'd like to both point out what I thought I knew and the point of view that has come to my attention lately and I seek help in determining where on that spectrum truth might actually be positioned.



**The church and slavery/forced christianization of indigenous people**  
*What I thought I knew:*  
Well, that's easy to describe. The church was forcibly converting people of different faiths to Catholicism, which led to people viewing newly discovered indigenous people like in north America as subhuman and without proper rights. It led to massacres among them (of note would be stories of how Columbus and Cortes acted).  
*The new picture:*  
Pope Paul III made the churches stance towards indigenous people rather clear in 1537 Sublimis Deus, where (and I take this from the German Wikipedia) it states that indigenous people are to be treated as people with souls capable of reasoning and their right to freedom and possessions are to be respected. It is stated that Christianity should be brought to them but it should happen through sermon and setting good examples. Nothing more forceful than that.  
Even before this, Pastorale officium was created which declared enslavement and despoilement of American indigenous people would result in an automatic excommunication (which wouldn‚Äôt technically even need the Pope‚Äôs knowledge of the incident and happen through god‚Äôs hand, I interpret).  
Pastorale officium was, upon urging of Charles V retracted but replaced by sublimis deus in about a month.  
This point is primarily what led me to question my knowledge of the church because this is verifiable, if you trust wikipedia to any degree, and different from what I thought I knew of the churches history. The following points are much more vague to my person.



**The Spanish Inquisition**

*What I thought I knew:*  
The Spanish inquisition was the most ruthless of all inquisitions. Inquisitions were used to stamp out any dissent among the Catholic populace. Torture was ruthlessly used against anyone not toeing the line and death sentences were handed out like candy.

*The new picture:*  
Inquisitions ere used to locate heretics, that much seems to be true. A heretic is a member of the catholic church, usually in a position of authority/teaching, that teaches things against Catholic doctrine (the most central tenets of the faith, like trinity, the nature of god, the person of Jesus and so forth). Since every baptized catholic carries, to a degree, some measure of priesthood, it could be argued that inquisitions could also be expected to go against average citizens if they engaged in false doctrinal teachings.

Now the intent of an inquisition is first and foremost to keep the teachings pure. However, as far as I‚Äôve been told the church did not take it upon itself to dole out court verdicts. A death sentence would always have been spoken by a worldly judge. The inquisition would merely deliver their ‚Äúprofessional insight‚Äù on whether the accused might indeed be a heretic. The definition of a heretic basically also means that upon the split of the church during the reformation, a protestant teacher was no longer subject to the inquisition. Certainly to a worldly ruler trying to stamp out the reformation but that would be a different matter.

The spanish inquisition was special insofar as it was active at a time and region after the reconquista of much Spanish land from the Muslims. Internal stability of the kingdom was problematic so the king treated religious dissent very harshly. The spanish inquisition‚Äôs task was to find dissenters and heretics and make them retract their heretic teachings and come back into the Catholic fold or leave the land altogether to remove them from the rather inevitable death sentence by the king. This goal of turning them around and reconciliation is also upheld in another Wiki article about witch hunts.  
Torture was used and people were incarcerated, however unlike worldly judicial systems, the inquisition had strict rules that forbade torture of more than 15 minutes and of practices that would leave lasting bodily disfiguration/harm. I was also told that inquisitorial prisons were much more humane than those of the kings of the time and inmates were better fed andhad access to medical treatment if necessary.



**Witch hunts**  
*What I thought I knew:*  
The church officially had people hunting witches to burn them at the stake. The inquisition had a central role there.  
*The new picture:*  
While there were forces inside the church that envisioned a dark cabal of people having consumated a pact with the devil and whom were actively working against the church and god (Thomas Aquinas seems to have kind of created that idea. Shame, I like much of his teachings otherwise), it seems to me the church did not prioritize witch hunts as while the inquisitions were told to investigate a witch upon accusation, to not actively hunt for them and to prioritise heretics over witches. Presumably reconciliation would have been preferred for witches too?  
It seems to me that the church and more precisely members of it had been swept up in the witch hunt craze, the institution as a whole did manage to take a more distanced approach to it than I was led to believe and incidents like Salem were driven more by worldly mass hysteria than actual church involvement (not that I would blame Salem on the catholic church in the first place of course).

I read on wikipedia that Malleus Maleficarum hat to contend with resistance from the church throughout its relevance in history. This would lend credibility to the statement that the organization wasn't completely on board with witch hunts.

**Galileo Galilei**  
*What I thought I knew:*  
Well, in short Galileo was prosecuted by the church for upholding a heliocentric solar system.  
*The new picture:*  
Copernicus had come up with a heliocentric solar system some years before. This was not well-liked by the church but since Copernicus died shortly thereafter, I am not aware of much clashing between the church and him. Copernicus being a capitular is interesting but I‚Äôm unsure whether it would have made a difference had he locked horns with the church.  
Be that as it may, the interesting part is I‚Äôve been told that Galileo did lock horns about the solar system issue but the reason the church actually prosecuted him was because he taught that the tides were created by the sun without having tangible proof. He was warned about this and prosecuted upon ignoring that warning.

**Propaganda**

While I see myself as a potential sympathizer with the catholic church yet still an agnostic, having delved into the natures of Martin Luther, Calvin and Zwingli and their behaviors during the reformation, I have come to the opinion that while the church was indeed burdened with corruption from within (still is because it is full of humans) and a reformation was the logical and probably necessary reaction to that, a lot of opinions against the church were also the result of less than ethical and factual propaganda during the reformation.

*What I thought I knew:*  
The church actively kept the populace from knowing the content of the bible. Sermons were held in latin or greek to that measure. Bibles were not available in local languages.  
*The new picture:*  
Translated bibles were available in every church and accessible by the populace. The idea of the population‚Äôs illiteracy to a degree stem from a misconception of illiteracy. Where we understand the inability to read and write your own mother -tongue, the term illiteracy was used in ye olden days to describe the inability to read and write the scholarly Latin. So among the populace there were people capable of reading their own language and the church provided bibles in these languages.  
Since printing presses were not a thing, those bibles had to be painstakingly translated by monks, making them expensive. Which is why people nowadays confuse the lack of a bible in every household with people being unaware of the bible‚Äôs contents.

  
**Marrying off teenage girls**

*What I thought I knew:*

Medieval Christians had their daughters marry around 12 to 14 years old, often against their will.

*The new picture:*

Rather meticulous church records show an average marrying age closer to 21. Marriages as early as 16 happened under special circumstances and with approval of parents.

Any younger and we'd be talking extenuating circumstances like a pregnancy. I am not sure whether girls would have been forcibly married to their rapists though.

217,1709367428.0,How did farmers in medieval Europe choose which crops to grow?,"I was look into modern crop yeild and today there seems to be a pretty clear picure, with crops like parsnips, carrots, and onions dramatically outperforming cereals in how much they yield per cultivated hectare.

It is clear how one could create a block or obelisk on all sides, since they are open to your chisel.

But when it comes to removing the bottom from bedrock, how could that have been done, especially on a long/deep section?

My only thought is potentially a section could be chiseled out to fit a person laying down, and once enough is removed the piece is propped out by blocks of wood or stone, until all of the block or obelisk is separated from the bedrock and being propped up by stone or wood.

229,1709352071.0,How often were secondary armaments on aircraft carriers really used in WW2 and beyond? And can you give me some examples?,"Title says it all. I've always been into history, specifically first half 20th century political and military history. Big deal, I'm hardly unique in that regard. But one thing I've seen relatively ignored is the military theories and tactics of the interwar period. At first, the entire idea of an aircraft carrier was met with skepticism. Some deemed them too vulnerable, which in the era of dreadnoughts and biplanes is a reasonable concern to have. A common theme of early aircraft carriers are big beefy guns that'd be found on destroyers and cruisers of the time typically tucked neatly next to the superstructure.

My question is, how effective were these guns? Were there any documented examples of carriers using them to any effect? My guess is they were primarily loaded with anti-air rounds and used as AA guns, though history is full of surprises.

I've always found early carrier designs interesting. What specifically got me asking this was seeing the Essex-class carriers before and after their modernizations, as well as this video of the USS Yorktown (CV-10) under attack: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/uqvn6e/the\_flight\_deck\_uss\_yorktown\_cv10\_under\_attack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/uqvn6e/the_flight_deck_uss_yorktown_cv10_under_attack/)

Separate but not necessarily independent schools of medicine at Salerno and Bologna in Italy, and at Montpellier and Paris in France emerged in the mid-tenth through twelfth century. Those at Salerno and Montpellier initially had Jews, Muslims, and Christians in attendance, but later fell under the jurisdiction of royal and ecclesiastical authorities, at which point the former two groups were excluded. From what I have read, I get the sense that the Church continued to exercise control of schools and medical practitioners directly or indirectly via the crown into the Renaissance.

A lot of historians I‚Äôve heard take it for granted that Roman hegenomy boosted Europe forward, but at the same time it‚Äôs taken for granted that interstate competition in modern Europe boosted technological development. Also the more I‚Äôve learned about the tribal peoples Rome conquered and ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù like the Iberians or Gauls, the more complex and impressive their civilizations seemed (they had roads, cities, agriculture and debatably states), and I imagine they could‚Äôve formed their own civilizations given the time.

 I think you could argue Rome hindered the development of their northern provinces, for example I think Rome hindered technologies that increased agricultural productivity in northern Europe (I might be wrong on that). It‚Äôs a trope that Rome where never really technological innovators, instead adapting innovations from other cultures. I've heard a story about how the Empire actively hindered technological innovation because it threatened the status-quo. As for religion, art and philosophy, my understanding is that it stagnated in the Empire. Rome also scorned their merchant class, which might of hindered economic development. 

In short, although Rome built pretty buildings in the territories they conquered, but rather than pushing the provinces forward, I think they taught the provinces to be reliant on central authority, and when that authority collapsed, it took Europe about 1000 years for large centralised states to remerge.

It‚Äôs also the time when most Baby Boomers are coming of age and drastically changing the cultural landscape because there are so many of them.

Now, by tapping into the youth‚Äôs need for change and revolution in China, and the huge success it became for him, Mao realized that his message of rising up against the Man and fucking things up got a lot of traction not just at home but abroad as well.

I‚Äôm wondering why Europe was able to colonize, effectively, the rest of the world?

Also, gunpowder was invented in China and the Arabs had the golden age of mathematics and science, so how did the tech gap between Europeans and the rest of the world get so large in just a couple hundred years, if they were seemingly behind just before the Renaissance?

I‚Äôm sure a number of things play into it: capitalism, religion (Protestant ethic), disease in the Americas/aboriginal areas, naval prowess, etc., but it seems like European powers just kind of rolled over the rest of the world and were able to effectively administer and extract wealth from vast colonial empires without restriction for hundreds of years.

For instance, did the Romans openly discuss their conquest projects as a matter of extracting economic benefits from them?

But I have found myself struggling to find information on the alleged AMX 50 Foch, a supposed French tank destroyer. I am aware of the AMX 50, a post-war heavy tank which got cancelled. And one youtuber played old black & white footage of what appeared to be the Foch, but only spoke of the AMX 50 heavy itself. And while I have seen some black and white photos of the TD on google, it's possible they could be edited.

The only information I've been able to find on it comes from the wiki pages of popular video games Warthunder and World of Tanks.  
""During the early 1950s, DEFA worked to produce the third version of the AMX-50 heavy tank which featured a 120 mm self-propelled gun, however, during upgrades weight became a factor severely hampering the speed of the vehicle. 1955 saw a team of seventy German engineers brought in to help solve the problem maintaining the 120 mm cannon plus have the necessary armour and maintain a 65 km/h speed. Due to the delays and problems encountered during construction, only five prototypes were constructed and only one was finished which became known as the Canon Automoteur AMX-50 Foch, named after the supreme allied commander during World War I, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, general and military theorist. The main purpose of the AMX-50 ""120 mm"" was to provide long-range support for the medium AMX-50 ""100 mm"" tanks. An ambitious task of designing a version with a 155 mm cannon was started, however, this never made it past the drawing stage."" (AMX 50 Foch Warthunder wiki page)  
[https://wiki.warthunder.com/AMX-50\_Foch](https://wiki.warthunder.com/AMX-50_Foch)

""From the late 1940s to the early 1950s, France was developing heavy tank destroyers. This project was developed under the influence of German tank destroyers of WWII. The vehicle featured a 120-mm gun. At least one prototype was built, which took part in the military parade in Paris on July 14, 1950. Never saw mass production"" (Wargaming.net AMX 50 Foch page)  
[https://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Tank:F37\_AMX50\_Foch](https://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Tank:F37_AMX50_Foch)

""In 1952, with the launch of the AMX-50-120 tank project, the French discontinued development of the AMX-50 Foch tank destroyer. A tank destroyer with the same 120 mm gun armament was thought to be unnecessary. There were attempts to upgrade the main gun to 155 mm, but these efforts were abandoned as France made moves to adopt standardized NATO equipment.""

339,1709253666.0,When did far-left and far-right as political labels first come into popular use as they are used today?,"I'm interested in better understanding the origin of the terms far-left and far-right to describe political parties and politicians. I understand from previous answers that using left vs right to describe political parties traces back to the seating arrangements in the National Assembly during the French Revolution. That these terms originally symbolized a divide between a revolutionary left and a right that sprung up to defend the monarchy's status quo. My interest lies in understanding how these labels evolved to how we use them today with terms like ""far-left"" and ""far-right,"" as well as ""center-left"" and ""center-right.""

  
When did popular political discourse begin to differentiate between varying degrees of leftism and rightism? Specifically, when were the terms ""far-left"" (communism?) and ""far-right"" (facism?) first introduced as they are popularly used today? Additionally, I'm curious if ""far-left"" and ""far-right"" initially had different connotations than they do today. Similarly, when did the concepts of ""center-left"" (social democrats?) and ""center-right"" (free-market classical liberals?) emerge?

  
In an attempt to find answers, I looked at Google's Ngram Viewer to analyze the relative frequency of these terms over time. This suggests that ""far-right"" and ""far-left"" began to gain traction in the 1960s, with a noticeable increase in the use of ""far-right"" during the 1980s. Conversely, the terms ""left-wing"" and ""right-wing"" seem to have become more prevalent first in the 1920s (at-least in American English). I don‚Äôt know if this represents the real introduction of these terms into popular usage though or is just some artifact of ngram viewer.  
I've also seen some similar questions answered such as: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ms2gtv/what\_did\_the\_political\_left\_look\_like\_in\_times/. But most questions/answers regarding political affiliation seem to revolve around whether Party X would be considered left vs right wing today. This seems more of a political science question if anything. I'm interested in the historical context of these terms as they were used at the time.

  
Any historical context, pivotal moments, or influential writings that contributed to this evolution would be greatly appreciated.

Is there any evidence to suggest that this is true, or is this mainly Hollywood dramatization? I know David Hill's speech actually happened, but it's only one person's testimony and I was wondering if there is more evidence. ",AskHistorians
368,1709226163.0,How did poor Medieval Christians keep faith when their religious leaders embodied the opposite of their faith's ideals?,"I have been struggling to explain myself, and failing lol But I will try my best.

I don't know how different modern Christianity (more specifically as it pertains to me, Catholicism) is from Medieval Christianity, what changes/adjustments have been made, etc etc but I know for a fact that helping the poor was always an important belief. There is a quote from Jesus, the alleged Lord and Savior of humanity, that pretty much says, ""How you treat the poor is how you treat me,"" and yet.....the wealthy & powerful treated the poor like the trash they saw them as.

I understand there are a multitude of factors that act as a barrier between the poor & uneducated and their faith (illiteracy, Mass not being in vernacular, next to no, if not entirely void of access to the Bible even after the printing press, etc), but I resent the notion that they were stupid and didn't know what was up. I mean, friars at the very least went around preaching, and I cannot imagine they would *not* talk about Jesus's hopes for the treatment of the poor. Yet bishops and popes grew fatter and richer and crueler, so what kept the Medieval Christian from growing disillusioned? If they *truly* believed what they were preaching, there wouldn't be any rich people in Christian Europe. At least, not amongst the clergy.

Obviously I am making sweeping generalizations (as one often does when speaking of a broad period of time and large swathes of similar yet distinct populations), and I know that this very subject is a contributing factor to what led to Martin Luther mailing out his theses; but Christianity had its roots in the Roman Empire and Luther did not incite a break from the Church until the 16th century. I'm wondering why the average person didn't look at how in direct opposition their supposed Divine and Holy leaders (both secular and religious) were in the very tenants and beliefs they claimed to uphold, and go ""Ohhhhh, so this is all complete and utter horseshit.""

I understand how the clergy and Papacy justified the Crusades, but I can't fathom how they could justify, ""Give all your worldly possessions & money to those in need; the Poor are the Holiest among us, treat them as you would our Lord"" then turn around and go ""Except I get to be disgustingly rich and poor people are gross, stupid, and deserve to suffer""

The thing is, this letter is already very old. I am worried that the document will degrade over time if I do not do something to preserve it.

I'm rereading The Count of Monte Cristo and I'm confused how bankers make money and how they become broke: Monte Cristo opens lines of ""unlimited credit"" with Danglars and then concedes he'll want 500,000 francs per month to the tune of 6 million a year. How is he meant to pay Danglars? How does Danglars make money from this? Does he actually bill Monte Cristo 6.05 (or whatever) million? And then later on how does people going to him for cash make him bankrupt?

Earlier in the novel the older Morrel has ""notes"" due for X amount from various creditors and it's mentioned he gave them at a certain percent but it seems that the amount he is to return to e.g. the jailer is just the remainder of the original amount of the note (quoting from my translation: ""I had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of Morrel & Son... these two hundred thousand francs were payable"")?

says:

>The record for having the most children who become successive rulers of the same realm might be held by the Mexican ruler Nezahualpilli, Tlatoque of Tezcoco from 1472‚Äì1515. The reigns of the first 5 or 6 monarchs of Tezcoco allegedly lasted for 217 years with an average of 36 or 43.4 years, while eight sons of Nezahualpilli successively reigned for a total of 30 years from 1515 to 1545, giving an average of 3.75 years.

And here is a link to a Wikipedia list of rulers of Tetzcoco.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tlatoque\_of\_Tetzcoco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tlatoque_of_Tetzcoco)

And the link included now goes to the same Wikipedia list that lists 8 sons of Nezahulapilli as rulers of Tetzcoco. So I guess that the list was changed and at one time showed five sons of Nezahualpilli and at another time showed eight sons. The talk page doesn't have any discussions of the number of Nezahulapilii's sons who became rulers.

My copy of *Kings, Rulers and Statesmen* L.F. Wise & E.W. Egan, 1967 doesn't list the rulers of Tetzcoco.

He did not settle in Jerusalem because of destruction of Jewish institutions during the conquest but there wasn't any forced conversion policy there, neither was there any forced conversion policy in Norman Sicily.

The Roman Empire then is the closest equivalent, expelling Muslims from their reconquests in the West. But no particularly forced conversion attempts before hand, just expulsion(which one could say is cohersed conversion and thus similar to the Iberian Kingdoms) and more importantly, no going after Jews who retained full legal citizenship.

The parallels to the Almoravids seem to be much stronger, for preceding states in the mediterranean not only making those that didn't adhere to their religion(the religion in general not like sect within one religion) in lands they conquered, feel the subjugation but to outright forced converted, like with the example of a Jewish leader killed in Morocco that refused to convert. So is it no coincidence that it was the Christian states that succeeded it in that area that then implemented forced conversion on Jews and Muslims?.

And even when it comes to looking abroad for possible Christian inspiration, best I can do from the little I know is to look at the Northern Crusades but here, using the story of John of Wirland as my source, Pagan tribes that allied with the Crusaders for whatever reason were not directly then forced to convert, tho they were prodded to convert at every opportunity, one of which ended with the death of John of Wirland.

472,1709129508.0,How accurate is Shakespeare's portrayal of military technology in Henry IV Part I?,"I have been reading through the history plays recently, and something that really struck me is Shakespeare's portrayal of military technology. Henry IV Part I is set around the battle of Shrewsbury, and the biggest focus is on what I was expecting: knights in shining armour, feats of ""noble horsemanship"", single combat with lance and sword, etc.

> Come, let me taste my horse,  

> Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt  

> Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales.  

> Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,  

> Meet and ne‚Äôer part till one drop down a corse.

What surprised me is that, paired with this, there is a lot of talk of cannons and guns. When Harry Hotspur talks of war in his sleep, he talks 

>Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,  

>Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,  

>Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin.

Falstaff refers to his ragged bunch of pauper-infantry as ""food for powder"", and is meant to be carrying a pistol (though he in fact keeps wine in the holster). Most interestingly, when Hotspur talks about how he denied the king's request for his prisoners because it was delivered by an effeminate courtier, he reports the courtier as talking about gunpowder as a kind of recent innovation that has made war a less heroic business:

>And that it was great pity, so it was,  

>This villainous saltpeter should be digged  

>Out of the bowels of the harmless Earth,  

>Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed  

>So cowardly, and but for these vile guns  

>He would himself have been a soldier.

I found the overall picture painted, of knightly combat not too far removed from Arthurian chivalry on the same battlefield as salvos of cannon-fire, quite captivating. Checking the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shrewsbury) for the Battle of Shrewsbury, though, there is no mention of gunpowder weapons at all, and much discussion of the use of the longbow.

So, my question is, first, how much has Shakespeare exaggerated the role of gunpowder in this time period? Has he invented it wholecloth, giving gunpowder weapons to period which had none, or just inflated its importance? Secondly, can we take him as more-or-less simply transferring his contemporary military technology back two hundred years, or is the situation more complicated? Do we see in the history plays a more-or-less accurate depiction of *Elizabethan* military technology, or a strange combination of Elizabethan and Plantagenet technology from a half-hearted attempt by Shakespeare to depict the technology of the historical period? When *was* the introduction of ""basilisks, of cannon, culverin"" to the English battlefield? Shakespeare is clearly aware of military technology as an ever-evolving thing, so it would seem odd to transfer the introduction of gunpowder weapons to the historical period if it had actually happened in his own living memory?

I'd be grateful for any commentary that helps shed light on military technology in either of the periods when the play was written or set, or on how the former imagined the latter.",AskHistorians

However, I also understand that many ancients cities had large contingents of foreign merchants, typically residing per the terms of treaties (again famously Cartheginians, pre-Punic War).

Would any foreign merchants stuck in a doomed city be killed as well, or was there some sort of system to save non-citizens of the attacked city?

Was it assumed any foreigners would be long gone by the time of investment? Or was this Roman policy much more flexible than commonly understood?

Wouldnt the sword often break, the edge get damaged, the guard get damaged etc. or wouldnt it be too heavy, I mean would it be worth it to atleast some huntsmen, gamekeepers, patrollers, messengers, scouts, foresters etc. (\~rangers), instead of carrying a separate soly fighting sword for selfdefence and a hatchet for bushcraft?

If not, why some of those are called hunting swords, was it only a fashion, wasnt it a fashion that derived from the tool?

If yes, were there also atleast some typical arming swords constructed and used kinda for the same matter? I guess two proper/full edges are more restrictive when you are trying to achieve sturdyness. I mean the question if it would be worth it is applicaple here even more, but more so about the width of the blade.

I came across this idea when I was reading (not the book, some pages on the internet, the book cover is for illustration here) about the American Civil War, where there were issued bowie knives (dont confuse it with the more modern idea of bowie knives) with basic D-guards, that were basically shortswords to daggers with usually one edge and were constructed in a way that they would serve in self-defence but also as a utility hatchet and a knife in one single tool. But Im not sure how much they were actually popular and if people had this idea even more back in history and how it was popular back then and ofc depends when exactly.

I'm hoping to get responses from historians who don't care about the outcome of the debate and who can comment on methodological issues dispassionately. 

A group of authors claim that by making inferences based on documents from ca 270 BCE or *after*, they can recreate ""historical facts"" from ca 500-400 BCE.  And thus, they claim, they can establish the historicity of the Buddha (ca. 480-400 BCE) *with certainty,* based on those later documents. 

My understanding is that historical methods are based on *primary sources*. A primary source is a *first hand account* of the events, written by someone who lived through them (possibly at a later date). In most cases a source means a *written document* (broadly defined to include coins etc). 

Writing began to be used in India ca. 270 BCE. In my understanding, therefore, there are no primary sources prior to this. And thus the whole idea of the ""historical buddha"" from the fifth century BCE is incoherent.

Many of them mentioned that Japan and its citizens saw it simply as progress, and in some cases even a return to earlier systems of government and ideology seen by their ancestors, as it was a step away from the shogunate and towards the imperial court. They did not see it as coercive or any other flavor of that term.  
  
Given that, my questions:  
  
\- Is the whole ""gunboat diplomacy"" situation realistic? When it came down to Western leadership coming to agreements with Japanese leadership, did the gunboats play a significant role? Were there literal threats of violence, or was it simply a matter of ""massive militaristic force asking a favor of small nation""?  
  
\- Given the significant difference in military power, couldn't these forced agreements paint Japan as a form of client/puppet state?

When I ask why the French are considered white, I mean why are they considered white to the far right in countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It seems a common reason why for example the Irish or Polish were not considered white was because they were Catholic and thus co sidereal inferior. So why then are the French exempted and viewed widely as white despite being very catholic themselves? Perhaps this is based on a false premise that race and religion are connected in ways that they are not, but I can't see why Irish immigrants wouldn't be seen as white otherwise (excluding the Ulster Irish, who were considered white because they were protestant).

I‚Äôd like to understand better how more philosophical and seemingly less human centric ‚Äúreligions‚Äù or philosophies impacted politics / culture.


As an ancillary I‚Äôm also a interested in general sense how perception of ‚Äúreligion‚Äù varied between Chinese and say Western European cultures. For example Taoism and Confucianism are often regarded as religion but in a European sense they more resemble philosophies / best practices on mindset and behavior. Yet some sources will say that Lao Tzu (the semi legendary founder or Taoism) was worshipped as part of the practice of certain sects of Taoism. Buddhism borrows many elements from Taoism and is much more of a religion as I define the word. Buddhism contains more mystic elements like re-incarnation and a more goals based pursuit as people try to reach enlightenment. Taoism (as I understand it) is quite vague and not particularly goals based, it doesn‚Äôt particularly deify people or focus overly on a clear concept of self improvement. It‚Äôs more of a stoic philosophy revolving around acceptance and appreciation for the experiences of life both good and bad.


I‚Äôve had a hard time researching this topic for a number of reasons:


1) Ancient Chinese history is quite‚Ä¶ancient, the information you find sometimes blurs the lines between historical account and legend.


2) Taoism itself is a bit opaque and vague, reading the Tao Te Ching doesn‚Äôt give you the clearest idea of what Taoism is all about.


3) Translation is highly imperfect, the Tao Te Ching is an OLD book, the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù language it was written is very much different from the modern language / dialects. People argue even translations in Chinese often miss the cultural context or changing elements of the language. Translating the book into completely different language families, and interpreting that translation with an entirely foreign cultural frame leaves open a lot of potential for misunderstanding.

However, in the eastern half of Europe (eastward of the Elbe), this didn't occur. Landowners cracked down on their serfs, and the system continued into the 19th century.

I learned that this was a turning point of sorts in history, as it in a way shaped eastern Europe's role as the agricultural region for the more economically developed western side, especially pronounced during the Age of Discovery. The west was able to enjoy the fruits of trade with Asia and Africa, grew economically and population-wise, which led to a system where they imported foodstuffs from the east, further solidifying the east's ""second serfdom"".

This arguably went on to weaken the strength of the lower class in Eastern Europe, preventing bourgeoise rebellions that the west experienced, and led to Eastern Europe being relatively less liberal or democratic.

I was having a conversation with my animation coworkers about the topic of men playing women in kabuki theatre and whether or not this had any relation to why English Renaissance theatre did the same -- and at about the same time, if I'm not mistaken. We performed some brief superficial research (ie, Wikipedia) and came up with some uneducated guesses. Please forgive us. We are but simple artists. Most of us are art school educated and/or high school dropouts, decidedly (aggressively) not historians.  
  
The topic came up when a Caucasian male colleague of ours needed reference for a Japanese woman character's pose. We sometimes have to quickly use what's at hand for reference and he used a webcam capture of himself for the pose. He presented us with a beautiful draw-over of her, utilizing some of his own physical landmarks. The combination of the drawing and photo reminded us of an onnagata. This sent us down an internet rabbit hole on the subject and some of us landed on those previous questions. If you'd be so kind, help enlighten us or point us in the right direction?

Surely they would have been swarmed from the sides? We know in the battle of Pydna small roman units filtered into gaps within a phalanx, surely around the side would be obvious?

627,1708982482.0,What was the position of a sebastokrator in terms of tetrarchy?,"I know that while the *kaisar* derived from the *caesar* in the tetrarchy, it soon stopped being regarded as a junior tetrarch and gradually became a high court rank, as opposed to the West, where in the HRE imperial authority was often referred to as *caesarea* potestas rather than *augustana* or *imperialis*, similarly to how outsiders such as the Persians and even the Turks continued to place higher importance on the title than the Byzantines did. The Western POV seems to be that, basically, Caesar = emperor and Augustus is a further embellishment on that, like a loftier style. Not so much the East, where being the *basileus* was what mattered and the *kaisar* was not a junior *basileus*, it was not a *basileus* at all.

According to my understanding, junior emperors in later Byzantine Empire were considered to be on the *augustus* tier in terms of the old tetrarchy, above *caesar*, but they had the dependent position of a *symbasileus*, a co-emperor, whose standing lasted as long as the rule of the senior emperor, the only one to be called *autokrator*, the real guy in charge. The *symbasilei* could be discarded on succession, which was often an outside bet or a new election, not like the defined and structure system of advancing within the old tetrarchy. So when the top guy died, a *symbasileus* didn't automatically get a promotion. But things were a bit fluid, and e.g. it was possible for a sole basileus to later drop in rank below the emperors elevated by himself from subjects (like Romanos Lekapenos demoted Constantine VII, who had elevated him). The senate and the patriarch and the army could elevate a subject to *basileus* while a *symbasileus* was still alive from the previous rule. I think I know of a single instance were such discarded 'emperors' were given the honours but nothing else, like they could wear the purple until they died but were supposed to keep a low profile and live out their days in relative obscurity without trying to do anything imperial other than dressing up.

The *kaisar* remained on the book and kept its traditions, it was nominally imperial, so it had a great appeal to to outside rulers and others coveting the title, but it was only nominally imperial. It was not even a *symbasileus* position. Or did the Byzantines consider the position to be equal to the old *caesares* of the Diocletianic tetrarchy? Was the kaisar legally a junior *basileus* in so far as the *basileus* legally existed at all?

As for the *sebastokrator*, I know it is a late creation, invented by Alexios I, who had a living *elder* brother whom he needed to honour with something better than *kaisar* and obviously *basileuopator*, sometimes used for fathers-in-law, didn't apply to a brother. *Sebastos* initially used to be used as a translation of the Latin *augustus*. So was the *sebastokrator* considered to be a junior *augustus* in Latin terms? When actually writing in Latin, like to a western court, would the Byzantines render a *sebastokrator* as an *augustus*? Was the sebastokrator thus in any way a *symbasileus*? Like someone who would be featured on coins? A member of the imperial college? I know he could not wear the imperial diadem but he could wear a crown, as could the *kaisar*.

This gets us to the point of the *despotes*, who ranked higher than the *sebastokrator* but didn't include anything imperial in the name of the dignity, basically 'lord', *dominus*. If the *sebastokrator* was technically a junior *augustus*, although not regarded as a *symbasileus*, was a despotes a non-augustus that ranked above some *augusti*? A guy from outside the tetrarchy who outranked the lower tetrarchs?

So in a way, I'm asking if, supposing the imperial chancery in the 11th century and later was writing in Latin, as it obviously sometimes was, would it be treating the *kaisar* as the old *caesar* from the tetrarchy? Would it be rendering the *sebastokrator* as an *augustus*, however junior he might be?

As far as I know, in the old tetrarchy even a *caesar* was an *imperator*, i.e. *imperator* came in two grades: lower *kaisar* (base emperor) and higher *augustus* (elevated above the *caesar*), but the Byzantines, who translated the *imperator* as *autokrator*, reserved it just to the top guy ‚Äî I'm not sure but maybe a *symbasileus* like a son or brother associated on the throne was sometimes given the title of *autokrator* too. So let's say we're in the 14th century and the chancery in C'ple is writing in Latin and has to mention a *sebastokrator*. So do we have an *augustus* who is not an *imperator*?

Next question, western kings were typically rendered *rigas*, later also *basileus*, perhaps sometimes *anaks* (the actual Greek king title, to which the *basileus* was actually lower in the initial period) but not sure about the latter, or in any case it would have been very rare. Under the tetrarchy, no doubt a mere *rex* from within the empire or without would have been considered inferior to a *caesar*. What about the Byzantines and their perception of the *kaisar*'s standing relative to outside kings, though? Did they view the *kaisar* as being superior in rank and character to western kings even when the title was carried by an old general distantly related to the imperial family? Did they see the *sebastokrator* as superior in 'tier' to western kings or more like a glorified royal brother, a sort of *monsieur*?

If the *sebastokrator* was not regarded as a continuation of the *augustus* position in the tetrarchy (if a very Herculean one, so to say), and if it was not regarded as a junior sort of *basileus*, a member of the tetrarchy, then were there situations or ways in which it or the *despot* could be seen as legally or technically *lower* than the *kaisar* despite having higher court precedence? Something like the *kaisar* getting a coronation and/or annointment (an imperial *sacra*) and the *sebastokrator* not getting it?

There were also dignities with equal precedence to the kaisar but without the imperial pedigree, like the *protovestiarios* and the *megas domestikos* ‚Äî did the *kaisar* in some way retain a higher character or quality that such elevated court positions, not imperial or royal by any stretch of imagination, lacked?

I'm also aware that there were dignities lower than the *kaisar* that involved the root *sebastos*, so perhaps it wasn't so august after all.

Or was the tetrarchy even legally and technically long gone, with the *despotes*, *sebastokrator* and *kaisar* as progressively less glorified and more distant relatives of the Big Guy, with any attempt to sort them out in terms of the tetrarchy a clear and hopeless anachronism?",AskHistorians

That being said, Zhang Yimou's *To Live* (1994), an adaptation of a novel by Yu Hua published a year prior, also seems to criticize the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution yet it was received with censorship, with the movie itself being banned in cinemas. Something similar happened to *The Blue Kite* and *Farewell My Concubine*, both from 1993. Granted, the latter also showcased an homosexual protagonist -which I guess was not well seen by the government- but what changed so that in just 6 years Beijing went from allowing a biographical -and I dare to say, quite sympathetic- film about the last ruling member of what it seems to be an universally hated dynasty with clear criticisms towards the turmoils of the 50's and 60's to censor films that portrait policies that, as it seems, by then were already considered an error of the past?

How true is this?","In a memorandum signed by the Lebanese diplomat George Antonius appearing in [the report on the Fourteenth Meeting of the Arab and United Kingdom Delegations to the Conferences on Palestine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150621130433/http://www.icsresources.org/content/primarysourcedocs/CommitteeReportOnMcMahonHussein.pdf), which Secretary of State for the Colonies Malcolm MacDonald presented to Parliament, the following is stated:

&#x200B;

>They \[the British\] dropped proclamations by the thousand in all parts of Palestine, which bore a message from the Sharif Husain on one side and a message from the British Command on the other, to the effect that an Anglo-Arab agreement had been arrived at securing the independence of the Arabs, and to ask the Arab population of Palestine to look upon the advancing British Army as allies and liberators and give them every assistance. Under the aegis of the British military authorities, recruiting offices were opened in Palestine to recruit volunteers for the forces of the Arab Revolt. Throughout 1916 and the greater part of 1917, the attitude of the military and political officers of the British Army was clearly based on the understanding that Palestine was destined to form part of the Arab territory which was to be constituted after the War on the basis of independent Arab governments in close alliance with Great Britain.

&#x200B;

This seems perfectly plausible as a strategy that the British would employ to garner support from the local population in a vitally important corridor through which they would advance against the Ottoman Empire, but it would naturally be interpreted by the local Arabs as a promise of independence (in a then still anticipated vast Arab state like the one the Hashemites envisioned). The Balfour Declaration also hadn't been made yet, so the British also probably wouldn't have had reservations about making a potentially contradictory promise to the Arabs in Palestine (Lloyd George's personal sympathies with Zionism notwithstanding), especially if it was militarily expedient in the war effort.

  
That said, George Antonius was a Lebanese Christian Arab Nationalist whose contribution to the committee was to argue in favour of the contention that the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence included what by 1939 was understood as the territory of Palestine in the area earmarked for Arab independence. His personal agenda would therefore be supported by any promises of self-determination made to the Arabs in Palestine (especially one predating Balfour), and I'd be interested to know if there is any evidence from the British side supporting his claim.",AskHistorians

While Western powers frequently invoke these agreements to remind the Cambodian government of its commitments, the Cambodian government counters by asserting that the PPAs ceased to be binding following the adoption and promulgation of its constitution, which was based on the PPAs' stipulations.

This situation raises several historical and legal questions: Were the Paris Peace Agreements meant to bind Cambodia and the 19 other signatory states in perpetuity? Furthermore, if they were indeed meant to bind in perpetuity, did all signatory states ratify the treaties within their domestic legal frameworks? Evidence or historical insights that clarify the nature of these agreements and their status in international and Cambodian law at the time of signing and until 25 February 2004 would be greatly appreciated.

* Some sources start with the western-style phoenix as portrayed in greek and roman culture^(1) which is not what I am looking for.
* One source compared chinese and greek phoenix but is not scholarly and does not include dates^(2) I found many articles that say the egyptian phoenix was the first^(3), but again, no dates
* Wikipedia says the phoenix is greek, but has analogs in other cultures, like egypt, which I am counting as phoenixs. It also says that egypt is traditionally credited as the first mention of the phoenix.^(4)
* Apparently, North American people's also have various stories of phoenix-like birds^(5) which leads me to think that the idea of the phoenix-ish bird emerged before people crossed onto the americas, which would mean it emerged at least 13,000^(6) years ago

So, that is what I learned on my own. I understand not all these birds are phoenixes, but they seem to have a lot of similarities. Does anyone know anything about this topic?

But why did Germany hate the Slavic people so much? Based on the below links, Slavic nations only caused a small fraction of German deaths in WW1.

>The vast majority of German military manpower and materiel was devoted to the invasion, which was carried out as a war of extermination with complete disregard for the laws and customs of war.\[9\]\[10\] Among the criminal orders issued by the Wehrmacht's High Command (OKW) was the Commissar Order directing the army to shoot captured Soviet commissars as well as suspicious civilian political functionaries.\[11\]\[12\] The Nazis believed that the Soviet Union's Slavic population, considered racially inferior, was secretly controlled by an international Jewish conspiracy.\[13\]

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western\_Front\_(World\_War\_I)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I))

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern\_Front\_(World\_War\_I)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_I))

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi\_racial\_theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_racial_theories)

> The Nazis, and even ordinary people, thought that Eastern Europe, namely the Slavic-speaking areas, was the most racially inferior part of Europe, and very distinct from the rest of Europe.\[133\]\[134\]\[135\] In addition to deeming them inferior, Nazis also viewed Slavs as the agents of Judeo-Bolshevism.\[136\] In a 1941 article titled ""Zur Psychologie des Ostraumes"" (""On the psychology of the Eastern Realm"") published in Zeitschrift f√ºr Geopolitik journal, Nazi psychologist Gustav Richard Heyer characterized Slavs as ""natural slaves"" predisposed to servitude, inhabiting Eastern Europe in a primitive state akin to wildlife. Heyer further depicted Germans as a ""Prometheus""-like figure for Eastern Europe.\[131\]

&#x200B;

to me, looking at all the above, the Nazis had a very strange reaction to the events of WW1. While the French and British had killed the vast majority of Germans in WW1, the Nazi reaction to that was to focus extreme violence and hatred towards Slavic people instead, in WW2.

That is like if the British attacked America, killed tens of thousands of Americans, and the US responded by killing millions of Native Americans or Mexicans. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

However, this intutive notion appears to be incompatible with how these titles are used in the real life, for example:

-Rulers of the city-states of the ancient Greece are denoted in modern English as ""kings"", e.g. ""king of Mycenae"", ""king of Sparta"" e.t.c. despite ruling only a fraction of ancient Greek nation

-The title of Japanese monarch is ALWAYS translated as ""emperor"", even in times when they rule only one nation aka Japan itself (e.g. modern day).

-Even more confusingly, there were ""emperors"" of Korea for a short time at dawn of the 20th century, despite Koreans being good contenders for the ""most devoid of imperialist ambitions people in the history of Asia"" award.

-Probably the most egregious: Queen Victoria being the empress in India, but ""just"" the queen everywhere else (how did that even work?).

The fact that a sword could survive across generations in several different civilisations makes me wonder if this was a common occurrence. Also, I've read about both Middle Eastern and East Asian sword blades being basically recycled, where a blade from like 100 years before would be attached to a new hilt. I imagine that they did this because of how difficult it was to make a new sword blade. Was this also common, or is that the case for only a handful of particularly well built weapons?


On the other hand, I imagine most other common weapons like spears were relatively easier to make than swords, or they would degrade over time, like bows. Is this accurate?

The natural 'sciences' of antiquity borders on what we have regarded, since the Scientific Revolution, as mysticism, if not downright quackery. Many a scientist (eg. Vesalius, Harvey) spent significant portions of their early career disproving Galen, and geocentrism was borrowed by Christians from the theories of Aristotle.

Female bodies have been found in the burial kurgans (reserved for Scythian warriors and rulers) across the Eurasian steppe. Question is what factors led to a civilization like the seminomadic Scythians being matriarchal at a time when most civilizations were typically patriarchal?

The sense I can make of this is more intuitive, associative, namely:

‚Äî Having been in Germany, I feel a much stronger impression of the cultural legacy of the Middle Ages than I do in France (in fact, the German equivalent of Renaissance Faires, as held in the U.S., are Medieval festivals).  My hypothesis there is that pork had a prominent role in the Medieval German table and that this cultural element has remained a fixture up through the present.  Though post-medieval, the Thirty Years‚Äô War (1618-1648) seems to have been, in its way, as major a chapter in German history as the French Revolution was to the history of France. I also know that this Thirty Years‚Äô War was devastating in its effects; might it have created greater cultural inertia in Germany, or impeded cultural transformation (including as regards eating habits, based on the assumption that pork, a more economical form of meat consumption, was a prominent part of the medieval European diet in general).  

The only pork dish I had in France, during my travels, was in Nancy, in the Lorraine region; was in eastern France, bordering Alsace,  and thus already in relatively close proximity to Germany. 

I‚Äôve not been to a European country where the legacy of the Middle Ages felt as powerful to me as in Germany; whereas France‚Äôs sense of cultural identity has been conditioned by the 17th and 18th centuries (by Versailles and the French Revolution),  Germany seems to have ‚Äî not entirely consciously, per se ‚Äî  a more positive, more  affirmative relationship with its medieval past than does France.   My layperson‚Äôs sense is that beer and pork in German cuisine may be a testament to that.

However beyond modern day politics there has historically been minimal resistance to Russia or developed nationalism in Belarus compared to Ukraine. There were attempts to establish a Belarus in 1918-1920 (just like Ukraine) during the Civil War, but it failed and Bolshevism was more popular, and during interwar period/WW2 there was some collaboration/separatism but far less than in Ukraine (with the Ukrainian nationalist OUN and UPA army). 

So why does Belarus seem to have a weaker sense of national identity compared to Ukraine? Both are East Slavic nations with very similar history (under Polish Commonwealth) and a very similiar language, so how did Ukraine develop a strong identity and Belarus seemingly did not? Is there a historical explanation for this?

>Three of the corpses had allegedly been eaten by the survivors, attracting widespread notoriety. Stories of cannibalism had been circulating since 1629 and became more common in the mid-1630s. \[...\] they entered folk memory and re-emerged in mid-nineteenth-century writing under the influence of other cannibal tales from the age of European colonialism.

&#x200B;

>Seventeenth-century accounts were already influenced by Classical mythology and baroque drama that used tales of mothers eating their children as motifs for absolute horror and depravity. There were numerous direct accounts of people eating dogs, mice and other less palatable animals, but those of cannibalism were always based on hearsay.39 The tales were fabricated and certainly embroidered in propaganda, mostly written by south-west German Protestants to rally sympathy, or as a metaphor for moral breakdown caused by the war.

  
On the other hand, Geoffrey Parker writes (*The Thirty Years' War*, 2nd edition, 1997):  


>‚ÄòMen hunt men as beasts of prey, in the woods and on the way.‚Äô wrote one observer, and there are even well-documented cases of cannibalism from the Rhineland in 1635.

783,1708847746.0,Did Polities in the Holy Roman Empire that dissolved monastic estates do differently economically than ones that didn't?,"I know throughout the early modern period, there were several hundred small states in the Holy Roman Empire, and after the war of the Schmalkaldic League, it was ""his land, his religion,"" so while there were obviously regional and local cultural factors, the personal religious preferences of a particular ruler could determine if a polity became protestant or not. This, I think, often went along with taking monastic estates, which could often be quite big, although I know many of those were their own polities.

My point is that due to the enormous number of states, many of which were similarly sized and in similar locations, but of different religions, or of the same religion, but did or didn't dissolve monastic estates, has there ever been a study of whether or not this was economically beneficial, detrimental, or had no effect?

I ask because it seems like monastic estates are huge drag on a state, not providing soldiers liek nobles or taxes like towns or peasants, just sort of taking up resources, from a purely economci perspective.

Obviously, I am ignoring the spiritual side of this, because if you are  believer in what monasteries do, then this is all for very good reason, but that's entirely a question of personal theology, I just want to know what effect this had economcially.

&#x200B;

I know there were much larger instances of the seizure of monastic estates like in England, Tang China, and revolutionary France, but cause there's nothing obvious to compare them to, it seems harder to judge the effect, the HRE's huge number of small states seems like it could be reasonably used as a statistically large sample of some sort.",AskHistorians

Both miniseries are dramatized but the basic facts are considered to be accurate. 

**Question Context:** In the Netflix miniseries *Painkillers*, a direct quote says that ""...Giuliani called the White House..."" prior to the investigation into Purdue Pharma being closed (or at least the investigation's initial chapter). Outside of that quote, other sources appear to suggest he leveraged extremely high level Washington contacts to help his client (Purdue), particularly as he gained nationwide recognition after his handling of the 9/11 terror attacks. The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma appear to be widely regarded as large parts of the opioid epidemic that ravaged Appalachia and other parts of America, beginning in the 1990s/early 2000s. The investigation centered around the unusually aggressive marketing of Purdue's drug, OxyContin. There seemed to be a feeling that major executives with the company would face real consequences (such as jail time) with charges brought by John Brownlee, the US Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. However, there was ultimately a settlement that was considered a very light slap on the wrist. No jail time was given out to any high level executives or members of the Sackler family. John Brownlee agreed to this only after his superiors in Washington intervened. 

**Question(s):** 

When Giuliani made calls to high level Washington contacts, does that include the White House during the tenure of George W. Bush and if so did Bush himself have any direct involvement in those discussions? Was there anger directed at the White House as this unfolded or did Bush not face political ramifications? Speaking more generally, was there a perception that Bush mishandled the opioid epidemic in a broader sense?

If the answer is 'no' to the questions asked above (particularly the question on direct contact with Bush), what was the highest level of government Giuliani worked with to help Purdue escape the harsher consequences that many were expecting?

823,1708810249.0,How did tucking your napkin into your collar become bad etiquette?,"Tucking your napkin into your shirt collar is typically considered bad etiquette in Western culture. It has been depicted as uncouth, often displayed by boorish characters like the 3 Stooges  and the cyclops in O Brother Where Art Thou?

I wonder when and how this became bad etiquette and if it has it always been this way?

It seems to me that both historically and now, a man‚Äôs suit was important and valuable, and so doing this would protect it much better than putting it on the lap. 

Some movies have depicted it being socially acceptable to wear a bib in some fine dining establishments, but I‚Äôve never seen this done in real life.

851,1708790342.0,Was Socrates potentially a stock character?,"So, a random thought hit me today about Socrates: **Was he a stock character?**

Many people debate whether he was real or not, considering he has not writings that have seemingly survived. The general consensus I've heard is that he was real, considering he's appeared in plays, like *The Clouds* by Aristophanes, which made fun of him heavily. I've seen this subreddit have the question come up a few times, but I felt this question was a bit different, and I didn't want to resurrect a four or five year old thread.

By I just had a thought this morning where I pondered if he could have been a stock character (I.E. a character who never existed, but represents certain set of character traits, acting as a stand-in for a more developed character, meant to be easily recognizable to the audience). For example, whether or not there's a real Satan, the character of the Devil has become a big stock character in fiction and media. He never really went down to Georgia, nor beat Cuphead and Mugman in a game of dice, getting their souls. He never got Tom Walker's soul in the New England countryside. We talk about the Devil in our regular speech, which, if an alien species came to Earth not knowing what that meant, could lead them to thinking the Devil is/was real, much like how we talk about other historical figures, like Caesar and King Tut.

So, what evidence do we have the Socrates wasn't just a stand in for what society in Athens saw as a stereotype for a philosopher? Plato cites him as his teacher, but that could just be like people who say they live like Satan or make deals with the Devil (I.E. they don't care about morals). Maybe Plato just saw the stock character as something to be admired and wanted to reclaim the name of Socrates for the better, giving the stereotype more nuance than it's traditionally afforded? Many Xenophon wanted to defend the type of philosopher that he felt was ""on trial"" in Athens.

If the only writings we had left in 2500 years about the Devil were stories defending his name, claiming he was on trial, and people making fun of him, people in the future might think he was real, too.

I don't really believe this to be the case. I don't have any evidence to support the claim, really, beyond some fun thought. But I felt it interesting and wanted to see what evidence we have that would disprove the idea. I'll probably pose it as a fun thought experiment from time to time to philosophy professors and students, but I doubt I'll ever actually try to convince someone this is undoubtedly, 100% true.",AskHistorians

I grew up with these films so the Hero's Journey has always been present in my life and I just presumed that it was a constant trend in Hollywood that I never thought to question. It was only recently that I noticed films before 1999 weren't monomyth films. The big films were often action thrillers and dramas but then from 1999 you get the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy (1999-2005), *The Matrix* trilogy (1999), *The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-2003)*, the *Harry Potter* saga (2001-2011), the *Spider-Man* trilogy (2002), and this causes the Hero's Journey to become a mainstay in cinema as a widely recognised trope that will go on to inspire countless films and tv shows after 2002. But why? What caused this first massive wave of monomyth movies?

I've heard the theory that the massive success of the first Star Wars prequel, *The Phantom Menace* (1999), even though it was widely hated at the time convinced movie producers to move towards franchises as a way of making money and this is what you see with all of the films I just listed. The point was to get the audience hooked with one well written movie and then just proceed to make money off of the audience's loyalty to the characters of the films and this can be seen in a bunch of media today. Marvel is well known for doing this with their 'Phase 4' plan. But why did these films that I listed use the Hero's Journey specifically?

""15. Keeping the Polished Surface of the Weapons from Being Seen Before Battle

*We find that the Romans and almost all other peoples when observing each other‚Äôs battle lines from a distance generally pick out the gloomy-looking line as more likely to win the battle than the one in gleaming armor*. This common view is clearly wrong for, after the judgment of God, battle is decided by the leadership of the general and the morale of the troops. Be this as it may, the authorities say that if woods or hollows are found in the vicinity, the army should be concealed in them and not be visible to the enemy long enough so that they will not be able to organize countermeasures; this would be until they are a mile or two away. If the ground is open and the air is clear, then the men should be trained not to wear their helmets but to carry them in their hands until very close to the enemy. If their shields are small, they should be carried on the chest to cover their mail coats, and their cloaks should be thrown back over the shoulder pieces of the mail coat until the proper time. The points of their lances should also be hidden. In this way, then, from a distance our army will not shine at all. Finally, by presenting such an appearance, something our foes also make use of, they will be impressed and even before the battle, will lose confidence.""

What is trying to be explained here?

More generally, I don't think there's a distinction between ""Arabian"", ""Arabic"", and ""Arab"" in the Arabic language; they all fit under the word ""ÿπÿ±ÿ®"" or ""ÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä"" (Arab).

Edited to clarify: There are different meanings and uses to the word ""ÿπÿ±ÿ®"", but in all cases, it's still the same word. It's similar to how the word ""English"" can refer to either the language or the people, but whereas there is such thing as ""England"" in the English language, AFAIK there's no direct equivalent to ""Arabia"" in Arabic (apart from ""ÿ¨ÿ≤Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®"" or ""ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ≤Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©"").

901,1708733048.0,Did the US Forget it had Legal Claim to an Atoll in the Solomon Islands?,"I was reading the wikipedia page for the [overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overthrow_of_the_Hawaiian_Kingdom#Republic,_United_States_annexation,_United_States_Territory) under the section titled Republic, United States Annexation, United States Territory, when in the third paragraph it states ""the Hawaiian Islands, together with the distant Palmyra Island and the Stewart Islands, became the Territory of Hawaii, a United States organized incorporated territory."" I was familiar with Palmyra Atoll, a US Minor Outlying Island today and part of the Line Islands in the Pacific Ocean, but I had never heard of the Stewart Islands.

It turns out the Stewart Islands are a dated name for [Sikaiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikaiana) in the Solomon Islands, which had been previously Hawaiian controlled. It appears the legal status of this atoll had been brought up before, quoting a 1998 US Government Accountability Office report on Wikipedia,

""Some residents of the Stewart Islands in the Solomon Islands group ... claim that they are native Hawaiians and U.S. citizens.... They base their claim on the assertion that the Stewart Islands were ceded to King Kamehameha IV and accepted by him as part of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1856 and, thus, were part of the Republic of Hawaii (which was declared in 1893) when it was annexed to the United States by law in 1898. The 1898 law identifies the islands being annexed only as the ‚ÄúHawaiian Islands and their dependencies.‚Äù However, the annexation was based on the report of the Hawaiian Commission which did not include the Stewart Islands among the islands it identified as part of the Republic of Hawaii. Report of the Hawaiian Commission, S. Doc. No. 16, 55th Cong., at 4 (3d Sess. 1898). In 1996, some Stewart Islands residents applied to register to vote in a plebiscite limited to Native Hawaiians. Their requests for ballots, however, were rejected by the Hawaiian Sovereignty Election Council.""

Notably this quote says that the residents of Sikaiana are not recognized as Hawaiian natives, not surprising considering their location, but it makes no mentioned on the territorial status of the islands nor the citizenship status of the islanders. Notably it also contradicts with the first source, saying Sikaiana was not mentioned in any records of Hawaiian annexation into the United States.

I also tried seeing if there was any record of the British Empire or the Solomon Islands claiming/incorporating Sikaiana however I couldn't find any. All I found was from the second source under paragraph 3 of the History section, ""In 1893, the United Kingdom established the British Solomon Islands Protectorate over most of what is now Solomon Islands excluding Sikaiana."" So according to that source Sikaiana was not originally part of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate when the colonial territory was first formed, implying that the British respected Hawaiian claims to the atoll, but it makes no mention of when Sikaiana was formally incorporated into the Solomons.

I also couldn't find any record of the United States ceding their claims on the island. Under the Carter administration the US did cede a good number of its overseas claims from the colonial era to their respective nations, including Panama, Colombia, Kiribati, Tokelau, and Tuvalu, but I could find no mention of Sikaiana, the Stewart Islands, or the Solomon Islands in those various treaties.

So I have to ask, did the US just forget it claimed these islands? Was there ever an official transfer of administration from the US/Hawaii to the British Empire/Solomon Islands? When did the British Empire/Solomon Islands actually incorporate this atoll? If no record exists, could it be said that the US unknowingly has disputed territory with the Solomon Islands today?

In the past day, for instance, I have seen a well-circulated social media post depicting a current world leader's face pictured alongside c20 fascists with the caption ""*history books will teach these in the same lesson*."" The condemnation by comparison here works on an obvious level, but the choice to do so in the future tense seems both specific and pervasive.

How deep of a history do we find of this charge that ""*history/historians/history books will judge*"" in popular moral debate?

I ask because the invocation of ""historians"" or ""history books"" here strikes me as a fundamentally modern rhetorical move for at least three reasons:

1. *It seems to presume historical moral progress*, in that it assumes that future historians will have different moral judgements than those being criticized, and it could only draw moral force from the implication that those future judgements will be superior.
2. *It seems to presume professional history*, in that it holds up historians as the morally damning judges of the future, rather than simply 'future generations', etc. Admittedly this feels like the weakest point of the three, in that I can imagine a substitution of ""chroniclers"", ""songs"", ""your grandchildren"" that carries similar moral force, but I've included it because...
3. At least in the very common ""history books"" variant, i*t seems to presume popular and standardized historical education*, in that it implies that those historical judgements will not simply be niche scholarly ones, but will be set in front of future generations in school, forming a public assessment of the target person/behaviour as wrong. This seems essential for the sense that a current public consensus is both presently lacking but inevitable.

943,1708707464.0,What was a superstition to Medieval Christians and how did it differ from miracles?,"I've been reading some Wikipedia articles about witch trials and other similar subjects.

It's often repeated that many didn't believe in superstitions and the belief in such concepts was a ""pagan superstition"". I've also seen somewhere say that all pagan worship was superstition.

This feels odd as there seems to be a belief in demons, and some early Christians seemed to think the pagan gods existed (as demons perhaps, I'm not an expert on this). So, did these entities simply have no power (and couldn't perform miracles) at all to the Christian mind during this time?

At the same time, Christians believed in miracles. The lives of saints would be filled with this stuff. From levitation to grand feats. They also apparently were fine with cunning craft which seems it included some supernatural elements.

I've also seen someone mention that many Reformers wanted to directly disprove many of these miracles as superstitions. So, some Christians did view even miracles as superstitions too at some point. Which is also interesting since Acts clearly has huge miracles associated with it. 

So, on to the questions: what was a ""superstition"" to medieval Christians?  If there was a disbelief in superstitions, how did they separate supernatural acts (like saintly miracles) into true or not? What even was the thought behind the idea that saintly miracles can happen but demon miracles cannot?",AskHistorians
