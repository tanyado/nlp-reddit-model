While Plate Armor Strength is often said comes from being literal metal, the real strength of Plate armor is their shape, allowing such thin piece of metal around 3 milimeters(0,3 Cm) thick to withstand swords, spears and arrow by just glancing off the main blow which carries all the momentum.

6,1709077562.0,"Why are the French considered ""white""?","This question comes with baggage and is bases on some loose assumptions that may be true. When I ask why the French are considered white, I mean why are they considered white to the far right in countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It seems a common reason why for example the Irish or Polish were not considered white was because they were Catholic and thus co sidereal inferior. So why then are the French exempted and viewed widely as white despite being very catholic themselves? Perhaps this is based on a false premise that race and religion are connected in ways that they are not, but I can't see why Irish immigrants wouldn't be seen as white otherwise (excluding the Ulster Irish, who were considered white because they were protestant). Obviously I am asking this moreso in reference to Germanic White supremacist in anglophone and Germanic countries , because I am sure the French do regard themselves as white.

There is also another circumstance that contributes not a little to my conviction of the weakness of ancient times. Before the Trojan war there is no indication of any common action in Hellas, 
nor indeed of the universal prevalence of the name; on the contrary, before the time of Hellen, son of Deucalion, no such appellation existed, but the country went by the names of the different tribes, in particular of the Pelasgian. It was not till Hellen and his sons grew strong in Phthiotis, and were invited as allies into the other cities, that one by one they gradually acquired from the connection the name of Hellenes; though a long time elapsed before that name could fasten itself upon all. The best proof of this is furnished by Homer. Born long after the Trojan war, he nowhere calls all of them by that name, nor indeed any of them except the followers of Achilles from Phthiotis, who were the original Hellenes: in his poems they are called Danaans, Argives, and Achaeans. He does not even use the term barbarian, probably because the Hellenes had not yet been marked off from the rest of the world by one distinctive appellation.It appears therefore that the several Hellenic communities, comprising not only those who first acquired the name, city by city, as they came to understand each other, but also those who assumed it afterwards as the name of the whole people, were before the Trojan war prevented by their want of strength and the absence of mutual intercourse from displaying any collective action.Indeed, they could not unite for this expedition till they had gained increased familiarity with the sea.

26,1709068085.0,What we’re the political / social impacts of Taoism in Ancient China?,"I’m quite interested in how “religion” impacts social structures and behaviors. I’d like to understand better how more philosophical and seemingly less human centric “religions” or philosophies impacted politics / culture.


As an ancillary I’m also a interested in general sense how perception of “religion” varied between Chinese and say Western European cultures. For example Taoism and Confucianism are often regarded as religion but in a European sense they more resemble philosophies / best practices on mindset and behavior. Yet some sources will say that Lao Tzu (the semi legendary founder or Taoism) was worshipped as part of the practice of certain sects of Taoism. Buddhism borrows many elements from Taoism and is much more of a religion as I define the word. Buddhism contains more mystic elements like re-incarnation and a more goals based pursuit as people try to reach enlightenment. Taoism (as I understand it) is quite vague and not particularly goals based, it doesn’t particularly deify people or focus overly on a clear concept of self improvement. It’s more of a stoic philosophy revolving around acceptance and appreciation for the experiences of life both good and bad.


I’ve had a hard time researching this topic for a number of reasons:


1) Ancient Chinese history is quite…ancient, the information you find sometimes blurs the lines between historical account and legend.


2) Taoism itself is a bit opaque and vague, reading the Tao Te Ching doesn’t give you the clearest idea of what Taoism is all about.


3) Translation is highly imperfect, the Tao Te Ching is an OLD book, the “Chinese” language it was written is very much different from the modern language / dialects. People argue even translations in Chinese often miss the cultural context or changing elements of the language. Translating the book into completely different language families, and interpreting that translation with an entirely foreign cultural frame leaves open a lot of potential for misunderstanding.

61,1709047047.0,"Why did Eastern Europe experience a ""second serfdom"" while Western Europe did not?","So with the Hundred Years War, the Black Death, peasant revolts, and other socio-economical factors, serfdom and feudalism in general declined in Western Europe. However, in the eastern half of Europe (eastward of the Elbe), this didn't occur. Landowners cracked down on their serfs, and the system continued into the 19th century.

I learned that this was a turning point of sorts in history, as it in a way shaped eastern Europe's role as the agricultural region for the more economically developed western side, especially pronounced during the Age of Discovery. The west was able to enjoy the fruits of trade with Asia and Africa, grew economically and population-wise, which led to a system where they imported foodstuffs from the east, further solidifying the east's ""second serfdom"".

This arguably went on to weaken the strength of the lower class in Eastern Europe, preventing bourgeoise rebellions that the west experienced, and led to Eastern Europe being relatively less liberal or democratic.

My question is, why did feudalism/serfdom not go out of favor in Eastern Europe? Why didn't they have ""notable"" peasant revolutions or develop into yeomans?",AskHistorians

I was having a conversation with my animation coworkers about the topic of men playing women in kabuki theatre and whether or not this had any relation to why English Renaissance theatre did the same -- and at about the same time, if I'm not mistaken. We performed some brief superficial research (ie, Wikipedia) and came up with some uneducated guesses. Please forgive us. We are but simple artists. Most of us are art school educated and/or high school dropouts, decidedly (aggressively) not historians.  
  
The topic came up when a Caucasian male colleague of ours needed reference for a Japanese woman character's pose. We sometimes have to quickly use what's at hand for reference and he used a webcam capture of himself for the pose. He presented us with a beautiful draw-over of her, utilizing some of his own physical landmarks. The combination of the drawing and photo reminded us of an onnagata.

126,1708982482.0,What was the position of a sebastokrator in terms of tetrarchy?,"I know that while the *kaisar* derived from the *caesar* in the tetrarchy, it soon stopped being regarded as a junior tetrarch and gradually became a high court rank, as opposed to the West, where in the HRE imperial authority was often referred to as *caesarea* potestas rather than *augustana* or *imperialis*, similarly to how outsiders such as the Persians and even the Turks continued to place higher importance on the title than the Byzantines did. The Western POV seems to be that, basically, Caesar = emperor and Augustus is a further embellishment on that, like a loftier style. Not so much the East, where being the *basileus* was what mattered and the *kaisar* was not a junior *basileus*, it was not a *basileus* at all.

According to my understanding, junior emperors in later Byzantine Empire were considered to be on the *augustus* tier in terms of the old tetrarchy, above *caesar*, but they had the dependent position of a *symbasileus*, a co-emperor, whose standing lasted as long as the rule of the senior emperor, the only one to be called *autokrator*, the real guy in charge. The *symbasilei* could be discarded on succession, which was often an outside bet or a new election, not like the defined and structure system of advancing within the old tetrarchy. So when the top guy died, a *symbasileus* didn't automatically get a promotion. But things were a bit fluid, and e.g. it was possible for a sole basileus to later drop in rank below the emperors elevated by himself from subjects (like Romanos Lekapenos demoted Constantine VII, who had elevated him). The senate and the patriarch and the army could elevate a subject to *basileus* while a *symbasileus* was still alive from the previous rule. I think I know of a single instance were such discarded 'emperors' were given the honours but nothing else, like they could wear the purple until they died but were supposed to keep a low profile and live out their days in relative obscurity without trying to do anything imperial other than dressing up.

The *kaisar* remained on the book and kept its traditions, it was nominally imperial, so it had a great appeal to to outside rulers and others coveting the title, but it was only nominally imperial. It was not even a *symbasileus* position. Or did the Byzantines consider the position to be equal to the old *caesares* of the Diocletianic tetrarchy? Was the kaisar legally a junior *basileus* in so far as the *basileus* legally existed at all?

As for the *sebastokrator*, I know it is a late creation, invented by Alexios I, who had a living *elder* brother whom he needed to honour with something better than *kaisar* and obviously *basileuopator*, sometimes used for fathers-in-law, didn't apply to a brother. *Sebastos* initially used to be used as a translation of the Latin *augustus*. So was the *sebastokrator* considered to be a junior *augustus* in Latin terms? When actually writing in Latin, like to a western court, would the Byzantines render a *sebastokrator* as an *augustus*? Was the sebastokrator thus in any way a *symbasileus*? Like someone who would be featured on coins? A member of the imperial college? I know he could not wear the imperial diadem but he could wear a crown, as could the *kaisar*.

This gets us to the point of the *despotes*, who ranked higher than the *sebastokrator* but didn't include anything imperial in the name of the dignity, basically 'lord', *dominus*. If the *sebastokrator* was technically a junior *augustus*, although not regarded as a *symbasileus*, was a despotes a non-augustus that ranked above some *augusti*? A guy from outside the tetrarchy who outranked the lower tetrarchs?

So in a way, I'm asking if, supposing the imperial chancery in the 11th century and later was writing in Latin, as it obviously sometimes was, would it be treating the *kaisar* as the old *caesar* from the tetrarchy? Would it be rendering the *sebastokrator* as an *augustus*, however junior he might be?

As far as I know, in the old tetrarchy even a *caesar* was an *imperator*, i.e. *imperator* came in two grades: lower *kaisar* (base emperor) and higher *augustus* (elevated above the *caesar*), but the Byzantines, who translated the *imperator* as *autokrator*, reserved it just to the top guy — I'm not sure but maybe a *symbasileus* like a son or brother associated on the throne was sometimes given the title of *autokrator* too. So let's say we're in the 14th century and the chancery in C'ple is writing in Latin and has to mention a *sebastokrator*. So do we have an *augustus* who is not an *imperator*?

Next question, western kings were typically rendered *rigas*, later also *basileus*, perhaps sometimes *anaks* (the actual Greek king title, to which the *basileus* was actually lower in the initial period) but not sure about the latter, or in any case it would have been very rare. Under the tetrarchy, no doubt a mere *rex* from within the empire or without would have been considered inferior to a *caesar*. What about the Byzantines and their perception of the *kaisar*'s standing relative to outside kings, though? Did they view the *kaisar* as being superior in rank and character to western kings even when the title was carried by an old general distantly related to the imperial family? Did they see the *sebastokrator* as superior in 'tier' to western kings or more like a glorified royal brother, a sort of *monsieur*?

If the *sebastokrator* was not regarded as a continuation of the *augustus* position in the tetrarchy (if a very Herculean one, so to say), and if it was not regarded as a junior sort of *basileus*, a member of the tetrarchy, then were there situations or ways in which it or the *despot* could be seen as legally or technically *lower* than the *kaisar* despite having higher court precedence? Something like the *kaisar* getting a coronation and/or annointment (an imperial *sacra*) and the *sebastokrator* not getting it?

There were also dignities with equal precedence to the kaisar but without the imperial pedigree, like the *protovestiarios* and the *megas domestikos* — did the *kaisar* in some way retain a higher character or quality that such elevated court positions, not imperial or royal by any stretch of imagination, lacked?

I'm also aware that there were dignities lower than the *kaisar* that involved the root *sebastos*, so perhaps it wasn't so august after all.

Or was the tetrarchy even legally and technically long gone, with the *despotes*, *sebastokrator* and *kaisar* as progressively less glorified and more distant relatives of the Big Guy, with any attempt to sort them out in terms of the tetrarchy a clear and hopeless anachronism?",AskHistorians

Rifles did have longer range and accuracy, but at that time they were expensive to produce and difficult to load, so they were only assigned to very few specialized regiments.

That being said, Zhang Yimou's *To Live* (1994), an adaptation of a novel by Yu Hua published a year prior, also seems to criticize the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution yet it was received with censorship, with the movie itself being banned in cinemas. Something similar happened to *The Blue Kite* and *Farewell My Concubine*, both from 1993. Granted, the latter also showcased an homosexual protagonist -which I guess was not well seen by the government- but what changed so that in just 6 years Beijing went from allowing a biographical -and I dare to say, quite sympathetic- film about the last ruling member of what it seems to be an universally hated dynasty with clear criticisms towards the turmoils of the 50's and 60's to censor films that portrait policies that, as it seems, by then were already considered an error of the past?

Hello guys! Like the title says, I’m interested in learning more about the 20th century, and more specifically, about the wars that happened back then. The three main conflicts I’m more interested in learning are World War One ,World War Two and the Cold War. Now the last time I opened a history book was during the second year of high school, about six years ago so my knowledge of these conflicts has pretty much faded. So what I’m looking for is one book for each conflict. One book that can sum up pretty much everything that happened. It would be preferable if the books concentrated exclusively on tactics; stuff like who fought who, who were the generals, what strategies they employed, how many troops fought, how many lost their lives, the equipment used etc. . So basically, the dry stuff. Now I’ve done some digging and found some books that seem to be pretty good but I’ve also found some people complaining that they contain inaccuracies. Your thoughts about these books, if you’ve read them, would be deeply appreciated and if you have something else that you consider better, please share it. Remember, one book for conflict. I know that is not enough to fully cover each war but I’m just getting started and I don’t want to get overwhelmed.

161,1708962580.0,"In a 1939 report presented to the UK Parliament, it is asserted that in 1916-17 the British distributed proclamations to the Arabs in Palestine promising them independence. How true is this?","In a memorandum signed by the Lebanese diplomat George Antonius appearing in [the report on the Fourteenth Meeting of the Arab and United Kingdom Delegations to the Conferences on Palestine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150621130433/http://www.icsresources.org/content/primarysourcedocs/CommitteeReportOnMcMahonHussein.pdf), which Secretary of State for the Colonies Malcolm MacDonald presented to Parliament, the following is stated:

&#x200B;

>They \[the British\] dropped proclamations by the thousand in all parts of Palestine, which bore a message from the Sharif Husain on one side and a message from the British Command on the other, to the effect that an Anglo-Arab agreement had been arrived at securing the independence of the Arabs, and to ask the Arab population of Palestine to look upon the advancing British Army as allies and liberators and give them every assistance. Under the aegis of the British military authorities, recruiting offices were opened in Palestine to recruit volunteers for the forces of the Arab Revolt. Throughout 1916 and the greater part of 1917, the attitude of the military and political officers of the British Army was clearly based on the understanding that Palestine was destined to form part of the Arab territory which was to be constituted after the War on the basis of independent Arab governments in close alliance with Great Britain.

&#x200B;

This seems perfectly plausible as a strategy that the British would employ to garner support from the local population in a vitally important corridor through which they would advance against the Ottoman Empire, but it would naturally be interpreted by the local Arabs as a promise of independence (in a then still anticipated vast Arab state like the one the Hashemites envisioned). The Balfour Declaration also hadn't been made yet, so the British also probably wouldn't have had reservations about making a potentially contradictory promise to the Arabs in Palestine (Lloyd George's personal sympathies with Zionism notwithstanding), especially if it was militarily expedient in the war effort.

  
That said, George Antonius was a Lebanese Christian Arab Nationalist whose contribution to the committee was to argue in favour of the contention that the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence included what by 1939 was understood as the territory of Palestine in the area earmarked for Arab independence. His personal agenda would therefore be supported by any promises of self-determination made to the Arabs in Palestine (especially one predating Balfour), and I'd be interested to know if there is any evidence from the British side supporting his claim.",AskHistorians

I know that southerners [dominated the post-civil-war historiography](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5hh6if/comment/db0fje7/) to the point that maybe most Americans alive today were taught that it was about states' rights in school. 

What I can't figure out is how the states' rights idea managed to be taken seriously apart from the Lost Cause people. South Carolina only seceded after the election of a free-soil president who I don't think was unusual in other ways--the immediate trigger was clearly slavery. The only states' rights controversies I'm aware of around that time were the existence of slavery itself, and the right of northern states to not force the return of escaped slaves (the south was in favor of the first states' right and against the second). Yes, states' rights had been a simmering issue for decades but, to my knowledge, not in the years leading up to 1860 except for slavery-related issues.

While Western powers frequently invoke these agreements to remind the Cambodian government of its commitments, the Cambodian government counters by asserting that the PPAs ceased to be binding following the adoption and promulgation of its constitution, which was based on the PPAs' stipulations.

This situation raises several historical and legal questions: Were the Paris Peace Agreements meant to bind Cambodia and the 19 other signatory states in perpetuity? Furthermore, if they were indeed meant to bind in perpetuity, did all signatory states ratify the treaties within their domestic legal frameworks? Evidence or historical insights that clarify the nature of these agreements and their status in international and Cambodian law at the time of signing and until 25 February 2004 would be greatly appreciated.

* One source compared chinese and greek phoenix but is not scholarly and does not include dates^(2) I found many articles that say the egyptian phoenix was the first^(3), but again, no dates
* Wikipedia says the phoenix is greek, but has analogs in other cultures, like egypt, which I am counting as phoenixs. It also says that egypt is traditionally credited as the first mention of the phoenix.^(4)
* Apparently, North American people's also have various stories of phoenix-like birds^(5) which leads me to think that the idea of the phoenix-ish bird emerged before people crossed onto the americas, which would mean it emerged at least 13,000^(6) years ago

>The vast majority of German military manpower and materiel was devoted to the invasion, which was carried out as a war of extermination with complete disregard for the laws and customs of war.\[9\]\[10\] Among the criminal orders issued by the Wehrmacht's High Command (OKW) was the Commissar Order directing the army to shoot captured Soviet commissars as well as suspicious civilian political functionaries.\[11\]\[12\] The Nazis believed that the Soviet Union's Slavic population, considered racially inferior, was secretly controlled by an international Jewish conspiracy.\[13\]

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western\_Front\_(World\_War\_I)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I))

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern\_Front\_(World\_War\_I)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_I))

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi\_racial\_theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_racial_theories)

> The Nazis, and even ordinary people, thought that Eastern Europe, namely the Slavic-speaking areas, was the most racially inferior part of Europe, and very distinct from the rest of Europe.\[133\]\[134\]\[135\] In addition to deeming them inferior, Nazis also viewed Slavs as the agents of Judeo-Bolshevism.\[136\] In a 1941 article titled ""Zur Psychologie des Ostraumes"" (""On the psychology of the Eastern Realm"") published in Zeitschrift für Geopolitik journal, Nazi psychologist Gustav Richard Heyer characterized Slavs as ""natural slaves"" predisposed to servitude, inhabiting Eastern Europe in a primitive state akin to wildlife. Heyer further depicted Germans as a ""Prometheus""-like figure for Eastern Europe.\[131\]

&#x200B;

to me, looking at all the above, the Nazis had a very strange reaction to the events of WW1. While the French and British had killed the vast majority of Germans in WW1, the Nazi reaction to that was to focus extreme violence and hatred towards Slavic people instead, in WW2.

That is like if the British attacked America, killed tens of thousands of Americans, and the US responded by killing millions of Native Americans or Mexicans. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

248,1708877902.0,"Is there any consistent metric by which Western European languages translate titles of some monarchs as ""kings"" and some as ""emperors""?

However, this intutive notion appears to be incompatible with how these titles are used in the real life, for example:

-Rulers of the city-states of the ancient Greece are denoted in modern English as ""kings"", e.g. ""king of Mycenae"", ""king of Sparta"" e.t.c. despite ruling only a fraction of ancient Greek nation

-The title of Japanese monarch is ALWAYS translated as ""emperor"", even in times when they rule only one nation aka Japan itself (e.g. modern day).

-Even more confusingly, there were ""emperors"" of Korea for a short time at dawn of the 20th century, despite Koreans being good contenders for the ""most devoid of imperialist ambitions people in the history of Asia"" award.

-Probably the most egregious: Queen Victoria being the empress in India, but ""just"" the queen everywhere else (how did that even work?).

266,1708866605.0,Would most swords have been handed down across generations? Was it rare for someone to buy or commission an entirely new sword? What about other weapons?,"So I've read about Arab, European, and Japanese swords that are/were hundreds of years old. The fact that a sword could survive across generations in several different civilisations makes me wonder if this was a common occurrence. Also, I've read about both Middle Eastern and East Asian sword blades being basically recycled, where a blade from like 100 years before would be attached to a new hilt. I imagine that they did this because of how difficult it was to make a new sword blade. Was this also common, or is that the case for only a handful of particularly well built weapons?


On the other hand, I imagine most other common weapons like spears were relatively easier to make than swords, or they would degrade over time, like bows. Is this accurate?


By the way, I don't necessarily mean literal centuries, but like a lifetime of more.

We feel you, and we’re here to fix it.

Ok, yes, this thread will still be a boundless, tormented ocean of \[removed\]. *But it’ll be on purpose this time.*

To celebrate our latest milestone, we promise that we’ll remove any comment you make below. No ifs, no buts. It could be a poetic, polished treatise on the historical method that would make Marcel Bloch weep in his grave – nope, it’s gone, suck it Bloch. It might be sycophantic praise of the mod team, or a bitter diatribe against the very concept of moderation itself – boom, done, deleted either way. Even the most cunning effort to simply post “\[removed\]” – a gambit that has definitely not been tried at least once by each and every one of those 2 million subscribers – will result in swift, brutal justice.

What do we offer in return for the pleasure of reaping your hard-wrought comments beneath our scythes?

Rather, we will endeavour to offer a unique artisanal service: each and every comment removed will receive a unique, bespoke removal notice, lovingly handcrafted to fit your removal needs. This will be the farmer’s market of moderation, where the boring, regimented vegetables of our standard notices are replaced by slightly wonky but extra nutritious organic produce, carefully cultivated in our well-manured minds.

But wait – we sense your doubt. How, you ask with your plaintive eyes, could such a small, elite crew of mods even hope to keep up with such a task? How will the AskHistorians moderation team – in normal times a grim, blackened factory line of shoddy, one-size-fits-all removals – even hope to make the switch to artisanal deletions while child labour remains unaccountably illegal?

269,1708862204.0,Was the burning of Alexandria significant in the course of history?,"The Burning of the Library of Alexandria is, as many consider, a significant loss to human culture. However, apart from the loss of some ancient literature and historical records, did the burning of its texts affect the progression of intellectual history?

The natural 'sciences' of antiquity borders on what we have regarded, since the Scientific Revolution, as mysticism, if not downright quackery. Many a scientist (eg. Vesalius, Harvey) spent significant portions of their early career disproving Galen, and geocentrism was borrowed by Christians from the theories of Aristotle. I have a hunch that even if the Library of Alexandria survived, most of its knowledge would be useless to the majority of the population, save for academics and history buffs. ",AskHistorians
270,1708861809.0,Why were the Scythians matriarchal? ,"The Scythians had a famously matriarchal society. Women were priestesses (among the highest social class) and served as political leaders (ex. Tomris) and warriors (the “Amazons” as described by Herodotus). All of this seemed to particularly fascinate and catch the attention the ancient Greeks. Female bodies have been found in the burial kurgans (reserved for Scythian warriors and rulers) across the Eurasian steppe. Question is what factors led to a civilization like the seminomadic Scythians being matriarchal at a time when most civilizations were typically patriarchal? The only direct descendant of the Scythians, the Ossetians, are highly patriarchal however that seems to be largely due to absorption of neighboring cultural influence (the likes of the Circassians, Chechens etc.) since the Ossetian Nart sagas suggest the Scythian-Alans were likewise highly matriarchal with female priests, warriors and rulers.

271,1708861146.0,Are there identifiable historical reasons why pork is far more prominent in the cuisine of Germany than of neighboring France? ,"Are there identifiable historical reasons why pork is far more prominent in the cuisine of Germany than of neighboring France?

The sense I can make of this is more intuitive, associative, namely:

— Having been in Germany, I feel a much stronger impression of the cultural legacy of the Middle Ages than I do in France (in fact, the German equivalent of Renaissance Faires, as held in the U.S., are Medieval festivals).  My hypothesis there is that pork had a prominent role in the Medieval German table and that this cultural element has remained a fixture up through the present.  Though post-medieval, the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648) seems to have been, in its way, as major a chapter in German history as the French Revolution was to the history of France. I also know that this Thirty Years’ War was devastating in its effects; might it have created greater cultural inertia in Germany, or impeded cultural transformation (including as regards eating habits, based on the assumption that pork, a more economical form of meat consumption, was a prominent part of the medieval European diet in general).  

The only pork dish I had in France, during my travels, was in Nancy, in the Lorraine region; was in eastern France, bordering Alsace,  and thus already in relatively close proximity to Germany. 

I’ve not been to a European country where the legacy of the Middle Ages felt as powerful to me as in Germany; whereas France’s sense of cultural identity has been conditioned by the 17th and 18th centuries (by Versailles and the French Revolution),  Germany seems to have — not entirely consciously, per se —  a more positive, more  affirmative relationship with its medieval past than does France.   My layperson’s sense is that beer and pork in German cuisine may be a testament to that.

273,1708859028.0,Why has Ukraine had a more independent relationship with Russia compared to Belarus? ,"Belarus under Lukashenka is very pro-Russia, part of the Union State and where the vast majority speak Russian and Belarusian is endangered and only spoken in the deep countryside. However beyond modern day politics there has historically been minimal resistance to Russia or developed nationalism in Belarus compared to Ukraine. There were attempts to establish a Belarus in 1918-1920 (just like Ukraine) during the Civil War, but it failed and Bolshevism was more popular, and during interwar period/WW2 there was some collaboration/separatism but far less than in Ukraine (with the Ukrainian nationalist OUN and UPA army). 

So why does Belarus seem to have a weaker sense of national identity compared to Ukraine? Both are East Slavic nations with very similar history (under Polish Commonwealth) and a very similiar language, so how did Ukraine develop a strong identity and Belarus seemingly did not? Is there a historical explanation for this?

276,1708858705.0,How do people in pre-westernized Islamic world sleep? ,"I've seen restored palace rooms in  and moorish Spain, and pictures/paintings of Mughal palaces, and other Islamic Indian 

I know that furniture is pretty scant in Islamic world before westernization sets in. People  sit in dais, on carpets, of low sofas against the wall. Storage are built niches in walls, ect. Food is either laid on the ground on a clean cloth, or on low tables that is then 

(Interestingly, it's still like this very traditional Islamic households in Indonesia! The house is filled with mostly carpets and bolsters on the floor. I was told that it's because Mohammad looks down on excess wealth and possessions)

But how do people sleep??? The few Mughal paintings of people sleeping; they sleep on a wide, low dais. But I think that's a privilege just for princes and kings?

In topkapi palace 'restored' bedrooms, there's no beds, no mattresses. Just bolsters against the walls. Do people just sleep on the floor? Or on removable mattresses? What kind of mattress do they use? Do they have blankets? I've seen plenty of Islamic world textiles  but never blankets 

I've tried googling it, but can't find anything so far

Bonus question; I've read that Mughal India has very few furniture because of their roots as nomadic people. But how about ottomans? And moorish? What is the common similarity on all these Islamic cultures that makes them use very little furniture? Is it a Quran doctrine?

284,1708849391.0,What was the prevalence of cannibalism during the Thirty Years' War?,"As I understand, Peter Wilson in *Europe's Tragedy* (2009) implies that original accounts of cannibalism (if there were any) were consequently exaggerated through folk memory, art and propaganda:  


>Three of the corpses had allegedly been eaten by the survivors, attracting widespread notoriety. Stories of cannibalism had been circulating since 1629 and became more common in the mid-1630s. \[...\] they entered folk memory and re-emerged in mid-nineteenth-century writing under the influence of other cannibal tales from the age of European colonialism.

&#x200B;

>Seventeenth-century accounts were already influenced by Classical mythology and baroque drama that used tales of mothers eating their children as motifs for absolute horror and depravity. There were numerous direct accounts of people eating dogs, mice and other less palatable animals, but those of cannibalism were always based on hearsay.39 The tales were fabricated and certainly embroidered in propaganda, mostly written by south-west German Protestants to rally sympathy, or as a metaphor for moral breakdown caused by the war.

  
On the other hand, Geoffrey Parker writes (*The Thirty Years' War*, 2nd edition, 1997):  


>‘Men hunt men as beasts of prey, in the woods and on the way.’ wrote one observer, and there are even well-documented cases of cannibalism from the Rhineland in 1635.

  
Both quote the sources I have no access to, but I can share them here, if it helps.

285,1708847746.0,Did Polities in the Holy Roman Empire that dissolved monastic estates do differently economically than ones that didn't?,"I know throughout the early modern period, there were several hundred small states in the Holy Roman Empire, and after the war of the Schmalkaldic League, it was ""his land, his religion,"" so while there were obviously regional and local cultural factors, the personal religious preferences of a particular ruler could determine if a polity became protestant or not. This, I think, often went along with taking monastic estates, which could often be quite big, although I know many of those were their own polities.

My point is that due to the enormous number of states, many of which were similarly sized and in similar locations, but of different religions, or of the same religion, but did or didn't dissolve monastic estates, has there ever been a study of whether or not this was economically beneficial, detrimental, or had no effect?

I ask because it seems like monastic estates are huge drag on a state, not providing soldiers liek nobles or taxes like towns or peasants, just sort of taking up resources, from a purely economci perspective.

Obviously, I am ignoring the spiritual side of this, because if you are  believer in what monasteries do, then this is all for very good reason, but that's entirely a question of personal theology, I just want to know what effect this had economcially.

&#x200B;

I know there were much larger instances of the seizure of monastic estates like in England, Tang China, and revolutionary France, but cause there's nothing obvious to compare them to, it seems harder to judge the effect, the HRE's huge number of small states seems like it could be reasonably used as a statistically large sample of some sort.",AskHistorians
286,1708845181.0,What was life like in the various Spanish territories of the Americas in 18th Century?,"I've always been fascinated by social history and have always wondered what it was like to live to in the many territories of the Spanish Empire in the Americas, there are certain questions I feel that needed to be asked.

1. How different was life in Spanish America (say for example the Viceroyalty of New Spain) in comparison to mainland Spain, both for the common people and the nobility?

287,1708844983.0,Why is hospitality not as prevalent and revered in North America as it was/is in other cultures?,"It seems to me that every ancient culture had a reverence of hospitality. The bible has the whole “treat sojourners well, for you were sojourners in the land of egypt” and the story where a guy is willing to offer up his virgin daughter to be raped by an angry mob to keep a complete stranger he invited into his house safe. 

The mahabharata has a story where a very poor brahmin offers up the only food he had, meant to feed his wife and child, to a complete stranger who he invites into his house as a guest. Of course, the stranger ends up being a god who rewards him. There’s also the story of Sudarshan the brahmin who lets a guest fuck his wife. 

And finally, the poetic edda has a story where odin straight up kills a guy for mistreating a guest. 

So clearly, these 3 very distinct cultures all revered hospitality. And I don’t know as much about them, but I think Islamic and Ancient Greco-Roman culture had a similar idea. I’m not sure why, but they did. 

But then in the USA, it’s the opposite. It’s 50/50 whether someone will even let a stranger into their house, let alone feed them or let them aleep there. I don’t know if other cultures are still so hospitable, but from my friends I know at least India and the balkans still place a similar reverence on serving a guest, even if they’re a stranger. Probably wouldn’t let you fuck their wife, but still.

308,1708824108.0,Why did my Jewish ancestors leave Croatia in the 1920s?,"I’ve traced my family back to some small villages in around Vocin, Croatia and I’m trying to understand why they may have moved.  My greatx2 grandparents had 4 children, born in 3 different villages around Vocin, leading me to wonder if they were regularly moving during this period. Per the census records I can find, none of these places had significant Jewish populations, adding to my suspicion that they were semi-nomadic. 

Ultimately they ended up in the “larger” town of Pozega where 3 sisters ultimately immigrated to the US in the 1920’s. Two of the sisters came to America unmarried, ultimately to marry Serbian Orthodox men in America. The idea of these women moving to America without husbands is another interesting fact that intrigues me. 

I’m hoping someone here can help add context to this corner of the world as a Jewish person.  I know the Ustase were especially brutal, ultimately murdering the sibling who did not move to America, but they moved just after WWI.  Any info or context anyone can supply would be awesome!

Two prominent mathematicians—Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz—have contributed greatly to the field of Calculus; however, they were unlucky to have been around at the same time and have created the same ideas (but independently). Newton, in response to Leibniz’s work, called Leibniz out for plagiarising his work, and Leibniz tried to appeal this decision by asking the British Royal Society for their opinion on this. It turned out this organisation’s president was none other than Newton himself and had the final call of claiming Leibniz to have plagiarised Newton’s work. With that said, given that Leibniz at the time was discredited by this prominent scientific and mathematical organisation, why is it that the terms used in Leibniz’s work lingered despite being discredited up until today?

Thailand is a surprisingly diverse country with Austroasiatic, Austronesian, and Sino-Tibetan groups throughout the country, let alone the different ""Tai"" people that got merged into one Thai identity in the 1940s. 

My question is how did they managed to do that without major problems or civil war? What did Central Thai/Siamese dominance look like to the average rural farmer?

320,1708817860.0,"What, if any, was the connection between George W. Bush and Rudy Giuliani regarding the Purdue Pharma case in the early 2000s? What was the highest level Giuliani worked with in Washington on Purdue's behalf?","**Background Research:** I have read *Death in Mud Lick* by Eric Eyre and reviewed articles from *The New York Times* and *The Guardian.* But the sources that sparked my question are Hulu's *Dopesick* and particularly Netflix's *Painkillers*. Both miniseries are dramatized but the basic facts are considered to be accurate. 

**Question Context:** In the Netflix miniseries *Painkillers*, a direct quote says that ""...Giuliani called the White House..."" prior to the investigation into Purdue Pharma being closed (or at least the investigation's initial chapter). Outside of that quote, other sources appear to suggest he leveraged extremely high level Washington contacts to help his client (Purdue), particularly as he gained nationwide recognition after his handling of the 9/11 terror attacks. The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma appear to be widely regarded as large parts of the opioid epidemic that ravaged Appalachia and other parts of America, beginning in the 1990s/early 2000s. The investigation centered around the unusually aggressive marketing of Purdue's drug, OxyContin. There seemed to be a feeling that major executives with the company would face real consequences (such as jail time) with charges brought by John Brownlee, the US Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. However, there was ultimately a settlement that was considered a very light slap on the wrist. No jail time was given out to any high level executives or members of the Sackler family. John Brownlee agreed to this only after his superiors in Washington intervened. 

**Question(s):** 

When Giuliani made calls to high level Washington contacts, does that include the White House during the tenure of George W. Bush and if so did Bush himself have any direct involvement in those discussions? Was there anger directed at the White House as this unfolded or did Bush not face political ramifications? Speaking more generally, was there a perception that Bush mishandled the opioid epidemic in a broader sense?

If the answer is 'no' to the questions asked above (particularly the question on direct contact with Bush), what was the highest level of government Giuliani worked with to help Purdue escape the harsher consequences that many were expecting? 

How vigorously did Brownlee resist his superiors, and did he have the authority to continue forward without settling the case? ",AskHistorians

354,1708790342.0,Was Socrates potentially a stock character?,"So, a random thought hit me today about Socrates: **Was he a stock character?**

Many people debate whether he was real or not, considering he has not writings that have seemingly survived. The general consensus I've heard is that he was real, considering he's appeared in plays, like *The Clouds* by Aristophanes, which made fun of him heavily. I've seen this subreddit have the question come up a few times, but I felt this question was a bit different, and I didn't want to resurrect a four or five year old thread.

By I just had a thought this morning where I pondered if he could have been a stock character (I.E. a character who never existed, but represents certain set of character traits, acting as a stand-in for a more developed character, meant to be easily recognizable to the audience). For example, whether or not there's a real Satan, the character of the Devil has become a big stock character in fiction and media. He never really went down to Georgia, nor beat Cuphead and Mugman in a game of dice, getting their souls. He never got Tom Walker's soul in the New England countryside. We talk about the Devil in our regular speech, which, if an alien species came to Earth not knowing what that meant, could lead them to thinking the Devil is/was real, much like how we talk about other historical figures, like Caesar and King Tut.

So, what evidence do we have the Socrates wasn't just a stand in for what society in Athens saw as a stereotype for a philosopher? Plato cites him as his teacher, but that could just be like people who say they live like Satan or make deals with the Devil (I.E. they don't care about morals). Maybe Plato just saw the stock character as something to be admired and wanted to reclaim the name of Socrates for the better, giving the stereotype more nuance than it's traditionally afforded? Many Xenophon wanted to defend the type of philosopher that he felt was ""on trial"" in Athens.

If the only writings we had left in 2500 years about the Devil were stories defending his name, claiming he was on trial, and people making fun of him, people in the future might think he was real, too.

I don't really believe this to be the case. I don't have any evidence to support the claim, really, beyond some fun thought. But I felt it interesting and wanted to see what evidence we have that would disprove the idea. I'll probably pose it as a fun thought experiment from time to time to philosophy professors and students, but I doubt I'll ever actually try to convince someone this is undoubtedly, 100% true.",AskHistorians

This makes a peculiar scenario where if I go to Tuscany I need some effort to understand the local dialect but I can read Dante and recognize it as my language, while for what I understand a person from the USA will recognize a person from London speaking the same language as him but will need effort to read Chaucer or Shakespreare.

As far as I know there are two theories about this, one is that he could sense early being defeated by Kemal and the Turkish National Movement and hence he completely abandoned Greece, and the other being that he genuinely thought he could win the elections, since he practically nearly tripled the size of Greece during his presidency.

I grew up with these films so the Hero's Journey has always been present in my life and I just presumed that it was a constant trend in Hollywood that I never thought to question. It was only recently that I noticed films before 1999 weren't monomyth films. The big films were often action thrillers and dramas but then from 1999 you get the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy (1999-2005), *The Matrix* trilogy (1999), *The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-2003)*, the *Harry Potter* saga (2001-2011), the *Spider-Man* trilogy (2002), and this causes the Hero's Journey to become a mainstay in cinema as a widely recognised trope that will go on to inspire countless films and tv shows after 2002. But why? What caused this first massive wave of monomyth movies?

I've heard the theory that the massive success of the first Star Wars prequel, *The Phantom Menace* (1999), even though it was widely hated at the time convinced movie producers to move towards franchises as a way of making money and this is what you see with all of the films I just listed. The point was to get the audience hooked with one well written movie and then just proceed to make money off of the audience's loyalty to the characters of the films and this can be seen in a bunch of media today. Marvel is well known for doing this with their 'Phase 4' plan. But why did these films that I listed use the Hero's Journey specifically?

""15. Keeping the Polished Surface of the Weapons from Being Seen Before Battle

*We find that the Romans and almost all other peoples when observing each other’s battle lines from a distance generally pick out the gloomy-looking line as more likely to win the battle than the one in gleaming armor*. This common view is clearly wrong for, after the judgment of God, battle is decided by the leadership of the general and the morale of the troops. Be this as it may, the authorities say that if woods or hollows are found in the vicinity, the army should be concealed in them and not be visible to the enemy long enough so that they will not be able to organize countermeasures; this would be until they are a mile or two away. If the ground is open and the air is clear, then the men should be trained not to wear their helmets but to carry them in their hands until very close to the enemy. If their shields are small, they should be carried on the chest to cover their mail coats, and their cloaks should be thrown back over the shoulder pieces of the mail coat until the proper time. The points of their lances should also be hidden. In this way, then, from a distance our army will not shine at all. Finally, by presenting such an appearance, something our foes also make use of, they will be impressed and even before the battle, will lose confidence.""

What is trying to be explained here?

While what is known as the region of Arabia in English is called ""الجزيرة العربية"" (the Arabian Peninsula/island) in Arabic. More generally, I don't think there's a distinction between ""Arabian"", ""Arabic"", and ""Arab"" in the Arabic language; they all fit under the word ""عرب"" or ""عربي"" (Arab). I understand that Arabia is what the Romans called the Arabian Peninsula, so does that have something to do with this? And if it does, why are there these distinctions in English when there aren't any in Arabic (as far as I know)?



Edited to clarify: There are different meanings and uses to the word ""عرب"", but in all cases, it's still the same word. It's similar to how the word ""English"" can refer to either the language or the people, but whereas there is such thing as ""England"" in the English language, AFAIK there's no direct equivalent to ""Arabia"" in Arabic (apart from ""جزيرة العرب"" or ""الجزيرة العربية"").

405,1708733048.0,Did the US Forget it had Legal Claim to an Atoll in the Solomon Islands?,"I was reading the wikipedia page for the [overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overthrow_of_the_Hawaiian_Kingdom#Republic,_United_States_annexation,_United_States_Territory) under the section titled Republic, United States Annexation, United States Territory, when in the third paragraph it states ""the Hawaiian Islands, together with the distant Palmyra Island and the Stewart Islands, became the Territory of Hawaii, a United States organized incorporated territory."" I was familiar with Palmyra Atoll, a US Minor Outlying Island today and part of the Line Islands in the Pacific Ocean, but I had never heard of the Stewart Islands.

It turns out the Stewart Islands are a dated name for [Sikaiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikaiana) in the Solomon Islands, which had been previously Hawaiian controlled. It appears the legal status of this atoll had been brought up before, quoting a 1998 US Government Accountability Office report on Wikipedia,

""Some residents of the Stewart Islands in the Solomon Islands group ... claim that they are native Hawaiians and U.S. citizens.... They base their claim on the assertion that the Stewart Islands were ceded to King Kamehameha IV and accepted by him as part of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1856 and, thus, were part of the Republic of Hawaii (which was declared in 1893) when it was annexed to the United States by law in 1898. The 1898 law identifies the islands being annexed only as the “Hawaiian Islands and their dependencies.” However, the annexation was based on the report of the Hawaiian Commission which did not include the Stewart Islands among the islands it identified as part of the Republic of Hawaii. Report of the Hawaiian Commission, S. Doc. No. 16, 55th Cong., at 4 (3d Sess. 1898). In 1996, some Stewart Islands residents applied to register to vote in a plebiscite limited to Native Hawaiians. Their requests for ballots, however, were rejected by the Hawaiian Sovereignty Election Council.""

Notably this quote says that the residents of Sikaiana are not recognized as Hawaiian natives, not surprising considering their location, but it makes no mentioned on the territorial status of the islands nor the citizenship status of the islanders. Notably it also contradicts with the first source, saying Sikaiana was not mentioned in any records of Hawaiian annexation into the United States.

I also tried seeing if there was any record of the British Empire or the Solomon Islands claiming/incorporating Sikaiana however I couldn't find any. All I found was from the second source under paragraph 3 of the History section, ""In 1893, the United Kingdom established the British Solomon Islands Protectorate over most of what is now Solomon Islands excluding Sikaiana."" So according to that source Sikaiana was not originally part of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate when the colonial territory was first formed, implying that the British respected Hawaiian claims to the atoll, but it makes no mention of when Sikaiana was formally incorporated into the Solomons.

I also couldn't find any record of the United States ceding their claims on the island. Under the Carter administration the US did cede a good number of its overseas claims from the colonial era to their respective nations, including Panama, Colombia, Kiribati, Tokelau, and Tuvalu, but I could find no mention of Sikaiana, the Stewart Islands, or the Solomon Islands in those various treaties.

So I have to ask, did the US just forget it claimed these islands? Was there ever an official transfer of administration from the US/Hawaii to the British Empire/Solomon Islands? When did the British Empire/Solomon Islands actually incorporate this atoll? If no record exists, could it be said that the US unknowingly has disputed territory with the Solomon Islands today?

In the past day, for instance, I have seen a well-circulated social media post depicting a current world leader's face pictured alongside c20 fascists with the caption ""*history books will teach these in the same lesson*."" The condemnation by comparison here works on an obvious level, but the choice to do so in the future tense seems both specific and pervasive.

How deep of a history do we find of this charge that ""*history/historians/history books will judge*"" in popular moral debate?

I ask because the invocation of ""historians"" or ""history books"" here strikes me as a fundamentally modern rhetorical move for at least three reasons:

1. *It seems to presume historical moral progress*, in that it assumes that future historians will have different moral judgements than those being criticized, and it could only draw moral force from the implication that those future judgements will be superior.
2. *It seems to presume professional history*, in that it holds up historians as the morally damning judges of the future, rather than simply 'future generations', etc. Admittedly this feels like the weakest point of the three, in that I can imagine a substitution of ""chroniclers"", ""songs"", ""your grandchildren"" that carries similar moral force, but I've included it because...
3. At least in the very common ""history books"" variant, i*t seems to presume popular and standardized historical education*, in that it implies that those historical judgements will not simply be niche scholarly ones, but will be set in front of future generations in school, forming a public assessment of the target person/behaviour as wrong. This seems essential for the sense that a current public consensus is both presently lacking but inevitable.

Pakistan gave it to islamist Pahstun groups like HIG and Hekmatyar, which helped lead to the rise of the Taliban (after Hekmatyar started the civil war by firing on Kabul, he began losing quickly and funds and guns went to another islamist Pashtun group most of us have heard of: the Taliban. Many former HIG fighters switched sides as a result).

Giving Pakistan control led to the rise of groups like HIG and, later, the Taliban. Why did the US not take direct control of the funds and guns? Why did it go through Pakistan instead?",AskHistorians

I'm not talking about the large plantations, but more about say the slaves that worked in households, or on small scale sites. Southern politicians and law enforcement officials were pretty indifferent to when lynchings took place, with police effectively enabling such extrajudicial measures to take place. Slavery continues to exist in many places in the world even where it is illegal, so was wondering if many southerners managed to keep their slaves, illegally.

It's often repeated that many didn't believe in superstitions and the belief in such concepts was a ""pagan superstition"". I've also seen somewhere say that all pagan worship was superstition.

This feels odd as there seems to be a belief in demons, and some early Christians seemed to think the pagan gods existed (as demons perhaps, I'm not an expert on this). So, did these entities simply have no power (and couldn't perform miracles) at all to the Christian mind during this time?

At the same time, Christians believed in miracles. The lives of saints would be filled with this stuff. From levitation to grand feats. They also apparently were fine with cunning craft which seems it included some supernatural elements.

I've also seen someone mention that many Reformers wanted to directly disprove many of these miracles as superstitions. So, some Christians did view even miracles as superstitions too at some point. Which is also interesting since Acts clearly has huge miracles associated with it. 

So, on to the questions: what was a ""superstition"" to medieval Christians?

This is my first question I've posted to r/askhistorians, although I've been a long time lurker and enjoyer of the content present in this community.

For context: my great great grandfather emigrated from a poor, rural fishing village in Japan to the Midwestern USA in the early 1900's. He left at the age of 16, and paid his way working as a deck hand on a ship in the Pacific for 2 years. To me, this seems like a rather drastic life choice to make - leaving everything you know behind to emigrate to an unknown country you know little about, can't speak the predominant language of, known for it's mistreatment of individuals of Asian descent, and even more, moving to a predominantly rural, white part of said country.

My grandma has recently been looking into researching this subject more heavily, in order to get some kind of context and perspective on my great great grandfather's life experiences.

This prompted me to wonder: was the quality of life for your average, working class Japanese citizen so bad that emigrating to the USA would seem preferable? What factors would lead to a kid from a fishing village wanting to leave Japan during their rapid industrialization period?

I have a few ideas myself: political turmoil and clashes amongst different factions of leftists and right wing authoritarianism, lack of job prospects due to said rapid industrialization, potential cultural issues due to the war-like nature of early 1900's Japan (Russo-Japanese war, etc), and so on.

Thank you for any help someone might be able to provide with this question! I look forward to seeing some interesting perspectives on this subject/time period in Japan's history.

I recently watched an excellent [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F7OAIRlKN0&t=2515s) by Prof. Michael S. Neiberg of the Army War College which has greatly influenced the direction I would like to take my essay, but there is one important peice of information which I am having trouble finding any relevant source to confirm. At the [32:00 minute mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F7OAIRlKN0&t=1914s) of the video, Neiberg states:

&#x200B;

**""William Jennings Bryan proposed buying Canada from the British, the British need money, we don't want them to give Canada to the Germans, give them a hundred million dollars for Canada. It's a safe, secure investment, it will protect our northern flank.""**

&#x200B;

This directly correlates to a previous argument that Neiberg made regarding the US purchase of the Danish West Indies. He argues that the fear of Germany forcibly taking the islands from Denmark and using them as a naval staging ground directly influenced the purchase. For this argument, I have found a [very informative article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220973.1941.11018745) as well as a [NYT peice written by Robert Lansing](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1931/07/19/118212044.html?pageNumber=111) in 1931 explaining the circumstances of the purchase.

&#x200B;

I have read Neiberg's book *The Path to War: How the First World War Created Modern America,* which the lecture was presumably based on, yet he made no mention in the book to the remark he attributed to Bryan, which has left me skeptical. I have dug through some *FRUS* documents and have yet to find anything pertaining to proposed U.S. purchase of Canadian territory.

After enough time passed, France became a proudly secular democracy, and a productive participant in European collective affairs. However, the immediate effects of the revolution were a nightmare both nationally and internationally.

Looking back from the modern era, most lay people tend to talk about the French Revolution like it was a good thing, and perhaps an inspiring symbol for modern leftists, but during the period of purging and global war, it must have seemed like madness and catastrophe.

When modern historians look back at the French Revolution, how many years seem like a net negative before the Revolution as a whole begins to seem like a net positive for Europe\* as a whole?

Seems like a difficult balance to achieve.","Apologies in advance for the long question.

I'm reading the fantastic ""Napoleon the Great"" by Andrew Roberts, and while it's the best biography I've ever read, I'm getting pretty annoyed after realizing that almost every single bad thing Napoleon did - massacres, harsh laws, the lack of empathy for civilians, etc. etc. - is presented with a little note reminding readers that the British did worse (while I'm left to wonder how they contrast with the original ideals of the Revolution, as the author doesn't seem to care that much about *that* comparison). It's very important to have that context in mind, of course, but for me it's presented in a way that is more concerned with justifying his actions than with providing historical context.

It also got me thinking that I'm facing the exact same problem, as I'm writing to my family about a slave-owning family member from Portugal, and while I want to provide historical context (owning enslaved people was very much common practice among his peers) I *definitely* don't want to come across as justifying it in any way. I've thought about pointing out that there was [a Portuguese priest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Vieira) who preached against slavery a century before, but he was an exception and possibly unknown to this guy, so is the existence if this priest really relevant for the context of what I'm writing? But then, if I just focus on his immediate context, wouldn't I be justifying what he did because ""everybody around him did it too""? I don't have training in history and I don't know how to navigate this.

So, how do historians usually manage to balance the need to contextualize atrocities in the morals of their time, with the danger of appearing to defend them from the perspective of modern readers? Is there a theory to it that would help me in my writings, and understand how reasonable is my annoyance with Andrew Roberts?

* The transition from hunting-gathering to farming wasn't that attractive (and many tribes abandoned agriculture) because nothing prevented your neighbors from waltzing into your garden and stealing all of your hard work. Late-stage sedentary societies did outfight hunter-gatherers. But they were at a disadvantage during the transition period.
* Therefore, early agriculture only made sense in desert flood plains as nomads couldn't walk across the desert borders to steal your stuff.
* However eating raw grains is impractical. You can boil them, but until coal fire stovetops appeared in the industrial age, you would need to cut down a lot of trees. Deserts don't have a lot of trees. Cities and villages rarely could spare the fuel needed to cook all of their calories.
* Therefore, river bank civilizations had an edge because they could use water powered mills to grind down their grains. Anyone else had to reserve a chunk of their labor force for manual grinding which was much less energy efficient.
* Over time, maps favored the states with the best unit economics for energy and calorie production as they could allocate more surplus laborers as warriors, craftsmen and buearacrts.
* Wind mills were a massive technology that shifted geopolitical maps because not only river civilizations had access to milling grains at scale. Competition with river states was easier.

I find this very hard to believe given that trying to run large organizations without written records and written communication just seems impossible. For example, if you were running a large  protection racket or a loansharking operation, how could you reliably know who owed money, how much they owed, and which mafioso you'd have to pay/order to coerce unwilling ""customers"" into paying their dues.  If the scilian mafia somehow never used writing of any kind to streamline their operations, what did they use to organize themselves like keeping track of membership and finances?

Section in question: 

""No documentation of Mafia activities  
There is a strict prohibition in the Mafia on writing incriminating information down on paper, lest such evidence fall into the hands of the police. In 1969, Michele Cavataio was murdered because he had drawn a map on which he had written the names of all the Palermo mafiosi he knew and marked their territories. He showed this map in meetings with other senior mafiosi to explain how he thought the Palermo families should be reorganized in the wake of a Mafia war. When Cavataio was murdered, his assassins searched his body for the map so that they could destroy it, but they didn't find it.\[175\]  
  
The prohibition on documenting anything also explains why the Mafia uses a bizarre ritual to initiate new members (see above). Since new members cannot sign membership contracts, the initiation of a new member is instead done in a ceremony with witnesses, and the initiate performs a specific series of bizarre actions so that there is no ambiguity as to what is being granted.\[170\] Likewise, since mafiosi cannot introduce themselves to each other by presenting membership cards, they must ask a third mafioso who knows them both to introduce them to each other and vouch that they are both members.""

598,1708567865.0,"If Latin America during the colonial period had an indigenous population, why did they need African Slaves?","In the book, ""Why Nations Fail"", the book touches on why the northern states of the US ¸did not have slavery. The Author noted that the British certainly tried to enslave the local natives, but because they lived a pastoral and migratory lifestyle; they kept running away and thus were not particularly conducive to slavery. That + the British not being directly involved in the slave trade meant they had to rely on indentured servitude from England. Of course, the south imported African slaves but the book otherwise explains why the cold north didn't have slaves. 

But in Latin America, those natives lived a largely centralized farming based lifestyle and thus were the perfect candidates for enslavement. And yet, while watching a pbs episode on Colombian cuisine, I was struck by how much African influence there was. Which made me wonder; if they had a supply of native slaves; why bother bringing in African slaves at all. 

So a quick google search turned up something I find impossibly hard to believe. Apparently, the Spanish conquistador, Bartolomé de las Casas, was so horrified by the treatment of the indigenous, that he convinced the Queen of Spain that the natives shouldn't be enslaved and instead to use African slaves.  How could the conquistador have a bleeding heart for the plight of one group of foreigners and yet has seemingly 0 qualms about the plight of another. 

I feel like I am missing something to this story.

•Do scholars consider the ""Beyond the Jordan"" that's in various Gospels to be the Tetrarchy of Herod Phillip?


Encyclopedia Brittanica notes that the founder of the Herodian Dynasty, Herod the Great, was not ethnically Jewish, but that his family converted; he was patrilineally Edomite and matrilineally [Nabataean Arab](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herod-king-of-Judaea) -- and it notes that some historians put Edom under the Arab Confederacy of that time. (Josephus wrote that they converted, but that there was one long-ago Jewish ancestor). The last member recorded apostasizes from Judaism when he moves. 


The Gospel of Luke puts Ituraea and Trachonitus in Herod Phillip's territory --  definitely not Jewish majorities afaik? Ituraea had a modified Nabataean script, Trachonitus, the Biblical tribe of 
Manasseh had disappeared among the original inhabitants. 

Josephus writes that Batanaea --  formerly within Nabataea --was in Phillip’s tetrarchy. So, did Phillip’s troops flipping to the Arab side in the Galilee-Nabataea war (begins when Herod chooses Herodias, won by 36 CE, so it’s concurrent with the ballpark dates for Jesus’ mission afaik), as per Josephus, get any mention in the New Testament?

•Jewish First Century historian Josephus discussed an earlier coalition of Jews and Arabians against the Second Temple, quoted below -- do historians think this is related at all?

>[So Aretas united the forces of the Arabians and of the Jews together; and pressed on the siege vigorously](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-14.html)

•4th C Epiphanius of Salamis traveled to Nabataea to interview the Jewish Essene diaspora that had escaped  to Arabian Nabataea. These Oessenes reported to him that Jesus *did* become a king after surviving, which he listed in his heresies. (That would be a theocratic one -prophet/priest/king -because that was the Eastern model, afaik.)

642,1708534697.0,Can Amateurs Help Create Historical Datasets?,"Apologies if this doesn't belong here, as it is more about behind-the-scenes historian work and I'm a complete amateur, albeit one with a strong interest. I started a little project that I wanted to see if was useful to continue or had already been done in an academic setting.  
  
I've started taking the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official\_Records\_of\_the\_Union\_and\_Confederate\_Armies and splitting it into a smaller dataset that could be used in AI training. The theory here is to be able to query this and other datasets to find correlations, connections, relationships, tones, etc. that may be missed otherwise.  
  
To that end, I've started on Volume 2 (mainly because the geographic area is more familiar to me). https://github.com/AdmiralEM/dataset-civil\_war\_records/tree/main/Volume%202  
With this, I'm breaking down the document using the OCR txt file from Cornell and comparing it to the scanned PDF of the volume. Once splitting I'm creating a .json metadata file that has all the attributes of the correspondence in it, author, date, location, recipient, type of document, and then tags based on the content and a summary. I'm also including a UUID to ensure matching the .txt file to the .json file and for use when these are compiled into a database.  
  
I've done this sort of work before, but not on something so large, something historic, nor something that either could have been done by someone else or that others may find use in. So, this could just be an amateur exercise or something that could be really fun and cool in the long run. And the format, if academically correct, could be used for many other types of documents or sources as well.  
  
I'd be interested in any feedback, directions to look, or an appropriate subreddit or forum to talk about this in the off chance that I'm on to something useful here.

“‘We might run down to the South Pasture for some mushrooms. Father said the reason we found so few was that people go by sunrise for them to take to market. The sun's only just rising, we should be sure to find some, and they would do for breakfast.’ […] The Tailor had been right, there was no lack of mushrooms at this time of the morning. All over the pasture they stood, of all sizes, some like buttons, some like tables; and in the distance one or two ragged women, stooping over them with baskets, looked like huge fungi also.”

Not to mention the nomad population that was huge, and although [we know for a fact](https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&context=himalaya) that some of those nomads were pretty much serfs, we don't know if that was the case for all, even most, of them.

If so, was this because they adopted sedentary farming and state formation later than Old World peoples?","Historian Camilla Townsend is very insistent on this idea. In her book Fifth Sun (2019), she writes:

“When the people of Eurasia later met those of the Americas, decisions that human beings had made about farming in those early times would determine their fates, in the sense that the past determined their degree of strength relative to each other” (Townsend 17).

“The Mexica knew that they were losing. They had no way to explain the discrepancy between their power and that of their enemies; they had no way of knowing that the Europeans were heirs to a ten-thousand-year-old tradition of sedentary living, and they themselves the heirs of barely three thousand” (Townsend 126).

She also insists on this idea in a 2021 review of David Carballo’s book Collision of Worlds (2020):

""Carballo, despite being an archaeologist, is unwilling to remind his readers that when the collision came in the early sixteenth century, the Old World peoples had by then experienced many more millennia of fully sedentary agricultural life and thus had both the population and technologies that would be requisite for conquest. Instead, presumably in deference to his historian colleagues, he offers us a vision of Aztec loss as culturally induced.""

716,1708474903.0,How common was conversion to Judaism in Antiquity and Late Antiquity across Italy and Greece? Are modern Jews in Europe primarily descended from them as opposed to Judeans in the ethnic sense?,"Hello, recently I have been hearing that Jews sought out converts in Italy during Late Antiquity, and they eventually outnumbered the Jews who immigrated there during the Roman Era, using Histories 5.5 for instance as an example ([https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0080%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D5](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0080%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D5)) communicates this was at least concern enough to the Romans to state the practice

>Those who come over to their religion adopt the practice, and have this lesson first instilled into them, to despise all gods, to disown their country, and set at nought parents, children, and brethren.

Another example I have heard people cite is a quote by Philo here: 

https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv3lEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT24&lpg=PT24&dq=“Our+customs+win+over+and+convert+the+barbarians+and+the+Hellenes,+the+continent+and+the+isles,+the+Orient+and+the+Occident,+Europe+and+Asia,+the+whole+world,+from+end+to+end”  


>Our customs win over and convert the barbarians and the Hellenes, the continent and the isles, the Orient and the Occident, Europe and Asia, the whole world, from end to end

Seneca also writes something which alludes to this being the case saying 

>“The customs of this accursed race have gained such influence that they are now received throughout all the world. The vanquished have given laws to the victors” 
>— On Superstition, Seneca (1st Century BC to AD)

https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/261/edited_volume/chapter/2753719 shows this, he could be talking about Christianity here, as I know at the time Romans viewed them similarly (although they had more distaste for Christianity as a passive, universalistic faith, while they still disliked Judaism but respected the tradition of their ancestors, etc) so tell me if this quote is likely referring to christianity, rather than Judaism. My question pertains converts to what we consider pre-Rabbinical Judaism and rabbinic Judaism, not Christianity. 


How likely is it that Jews in Europe are majority descended from converts in light of these quotes, and why do Historians like Louis Feldman claim that conversions, in light of this, was limited in scope or minimal. I find this here:   
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion\_to\_Judaism#In\_ancient\_times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_to_Judaism#In_ancient_times)  


>Louis Feldman's views on active Jewish missionizing have changed.\[further explanation needed\] While viewing classical Judaism as being receptive to converts, especially from the second century BC through the first century AD, he points to a lack of either missionizing tracts or records of the names of rabbis who sought converts as evidence for the lack of active Jewish missionizing.\[22\]: 205–06  Feldman maintains that conversion to Judaism was common and the Jewish population was large both within the Land of Israel and in the Diaspora.\[22\]: 183–203, 206  Other historians believe that conversion during the Roman era was limited in number and did not account for much of the Jewish population growth, due to various factors such as the illegality of male conversion to Judaism in the Roman world from the mid-second century. Another factor that made conversion difficult in the Roman world was the halakhic requirement of circumcision, a requirement that proselytizing Christianity quickly dropped. The Fiscus Judaicus, a tax imposed on Jews in 70 AD and relaxed to exclude Christians in 96 AD, also limited Judaism's appeal.\[23\]

Hello, so specifically I am asking about this because I want to know why these methods were used? what made them practical? Were they even practical?

I know it was much more difficult to contain criminals back then, well- not so much contain as keep them from starvation in said containment, as much as I know most serious criminals were just executed.

I am asking this question because of the ethical question I keep answering and feeling like I don't have enough knowledge to answer:  What do you do with a dangerous individual who you can punish but don't have the resources to imprison (at least, to imprison without the resources spent on said imprisonment not being a life and death matter for innocent people).

Do you just kill em?

Preceding this question I was asking a person I know about slavery in the bible (I'm not asking about the bible here btw, this is just for context so you understand more about my question) and I immedietly told them there is no justification, they then proceeded to explain to me about the instance I was talking about being the consequences of said slave's crimes, and that he was given a choice to die or be a slave, now whether or not thats the true context I realized ""Huh, thats not unrealistic."" and in that case even if the criminal escapes their shackles and causes a lot of damage and harm, most of such cases would result in years worth of labour that would likely outweigh the risk.

Now I can't make that judgement on my own, so I ask you if historically this has been a real and effective method, and if it was not or if it was not popular- What were different ways in which criminals that remained alive paid off that risk, their prison, or their food?

From what I learned for a very long time Asia as a whole even rich developed first world countries such as Japan and Israel primarily used squat toilet even at home. And the same for the Middle East. In fact at least for public locations the Middle East still uses squat toilets as the norm esp at public rest stops and a lot of SouthEast Asian buildings not just public restrooms but even restaurants and super market still uses squat toilets even though sky scrapers and business buildings along with most new homes now have toilet seats.

I'm wondering why was squat toilets the norm for these places (and still are pretty common in some of the poorer countries like my ancestral homeland India)? I mean in Roman times they already had seats to crap in even in places without pipes to bring running water like Roman military camps and small rural villages! So I have to ask why squatting toilets became the norm in half of the world despite seats being common as far as Julius Caesar's time in Europe?

I mean what makes this so bizarre is that the Philippines adopted seated toilets as the norm after World War 2. To the point that lots of people from that country are surprised to come across any toilet with a squat toilet to the point those coming from the predominant Tagalog regions especially Manila don't even know how to use it and instructions had to be posted in the still very few public bathrooms that have them which are far out of the big cities and in the most isolated rural regions. Even then the rural backwaters of the Philippines had already adopted toilet seats as the norm even in public restrooms at remote places like parks.

So I'm rather confused other other countries that became even far richer than Philippines did at her peak in particular Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong had stuck to squatting toilets even at home for a very long time. Tot the point it required government mandates to modernize public restrooms in order to get rid of squat toilets and replace them with American style seats. How come Japan and other first world MidEast and Asian countries kept squats as the norm for decades unlike Philippines which adopted them so rapidly that at least public schools by the late 60s used seats as the norm?",AskHistorians

So my question is more *from the perspective of the revolutionaries*: was the case of Charles I used as precedent to justify that a king might be put on trial for treason, and sentenced to death? Did they try to replicate either some parts of the procedure or legal arguments used a century and a half earlier? Or did they try to distance themselves from the former case? Or did they not care either way? (Obviously there were some differences, like Louis XVI being tried directly by Parliament — viꝫ., the Convention — rather than by an *ad hoc* court instituted by Parliament like Charles I had been.

746,1708453140.0,What Were the Main Determinants of Which Countries Adopted and Developed Gunpowder Warfare in the 15th to 18th Centuries?,"I've come across a loose series of explanations over time:

* Warfare competition in Europe was denser and more intense and created a pressure to innovate and improve warfare capacity.
* Necessary early gunpowder innovations would not have been advantageous to some countries because of the nature of their main antagonists (ie primitive muskets were no help to Chinese empires to secure borders against steppe nomads).
* The level of sophistication of the metallurgic industry.
* Proximity to centers of innovation. 

I don't feel like this is quite enough for me to understand how things turned out. Specifically, why would the Safavids fall behind their neighbours the Ottomans in a heated neighbourhood? Why did the Mughals become one of the ""gunpowder empires"" to then stagnate technologically and get trounced by Nader Shah, even though they were in constant southern expansion?

748,1708452155.0,The administrator of Jerusalem Abdi-Heba addresses either Akhenaten or his father as “My God” in the El Amarna letters — do any historians think that vassalship to ‘divine kings’ in the Levant influenced the Bible’s concept of God?,"The basis for my question is in this Encyclopedia Brittanica entry called [“The divine or semidivine king”](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sacred-kingship/The-divine-or-semidivine-king). There it’s noted that it’s Semetic-speaking peoples that have the *first* recorded instances of divine kingship — first Sargon of Akkad (posthumously), and then his grandson, Narram-Sin (while living)  -  considered Eastern ‘God-Emperors’. 
The practice continues through their dynasty, disappears, and goes through periods of revival.

The administrator of Jerusalem does this in [EA 288](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44089529),
and kings in Canaan do this as well, (for example, in [EA 282](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarna_letter_EA_282) “My God” is part of the deferential formulaic terms of address for many. Any personal name, like Akhenaten or Amenhotep, isn’t used, so we don’t know which one it might be). 

I’m especially thinking of instances where the Biblical God is directing multi-national coalitions of troops. Also, there’s how Elijah is directed to anoint a non-Jewish, but Semetic-speaking, king.

Sargon of Akkad is the first to establish vassalship in the Levant by conquering Ebla. By the 17th C BCE, the entire Levant is listed as a district under an Egyptian ‘God-Emperor’ —  and around 1638–1530 BCE is concurrent with the development of multiple, simultaneous and sometimes competing ‘God-Emperor’ pharoahs, like those Hyksos with Semetic names and traditions and their often-used title of “The Good God.” In other words, there doesn’t seem to be a time where the Patriarchs could have been operating on their own?

Academic consensus is that the various oral histories of the Bible were gathered and committed to written form in the 6th-5th C BCE by the Babylonian Exiles, so that seems to give a lot of time between the ascribed circa-2nd Millennium BCE Patriarchal Age and then — around 1,500 years —  for concepts to change and origins to maybe get obscured by the ‘mists of time’.

Like say for instances we wanted to invade Russia, we should decide whether it's feasible based on man power, strategy, technology etc not because Napoleon and Hitler failed.

We might have superior tactics.

> “Despite the scientific evidence, the tongue map has burrowed its way into common knowledge and is still taught in many classrooms and textbooks today.
>
> “The true test doesn’t require a laboratory, though. Brew a cup of coffee. Crack open a soda. Touch a salted pretzel to the tip of the tongue. In any test, it becomes clear the tongue can perceive these tastes all over.”

Most of us will remember the taste map from our childhood classrooms. According to the article I linked above, the concept is from a poor interpretation of [a 1901 paper](https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=FmAUAQAAIAAJ), and the map itself originated in [a book from 1942](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232480794_Sensation_and_Perception_in_the_History_of_Psychology).

Despite the taste map being debunked, it apparently continues to be a teaching tool today. I’m not going to link those links, but from a quick Google search you can find teaching resources online that still use the taste map.

So I’m wondering why, despite how easy it is to discredit, the taste map became so widely used, and for so long. Why did childhood educators just keep teaching it for decades?

783,1708423011.0,How common was battlefield archery in medieval mainland Europe?,"It seems to me that battlefield archery played a great role in many eras and regions - bronze age chariot-archers are well-attested all over the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. Later, the Persian empire employed archer-and-spearmen formations. The Eurasian Steppe reliably produced various horse archer cultures. The English developed their famous longbow tradition. 

In mainland Europe it seems to have been a bit different. The classical era Greeks and later Macedonians seem to have relegated archery to a supporting role for their heavy infantry and/or cavalry (but valued it as a supporting arm, e.g. the Cretan archers). Further to the west, the Romans (and probably Gauls as well?) seemed to prefer the javelin, to the all but exclusion of the bow.

Early and high Medieval Europe famously had a heavy cavalry (knight) tradition. As I understand, knights didn't think highly about infantry in all its forms (due to the medieval class structure), which, presumably, included foot archers. Nevertheless, archery (or javelins, or crossbows) seem too handy to completely abandon, even if they aren't your decisive arm. 

Knights seemed to like the bow for hunting, but that didn't transfer to the battlefield, at least usually. 

But in any case, it seems that skill with bows was not seen as inherently desirable. Or was it, and I just didn't read the right history books? 

So, say, on a ""standard"" (if there is such a thing) medieval battlefield somewhere in or around modern-day France or Germany, what would the common missile weapons there be? How many of them? How much would you need to fear them in comparison to the knights getting ready to charge? How much will the armor of someone protect them against the odd arrow?

And if it comes to the siege (which probably was the goal of the aforementioned battle anyway) missile weapons seem to be even more important. Would one expect the knights to get out their bows at least there? 

Did the role of archery evolve over time, e.g. due to encounters with various arrow-heavy cultures (say, Arabs, Turks, Mongols, English)? Was there some difference between the various regions of Europe? 

And finally, why was it like that? Is this only path-dependency, or social norms, or is archery just less worth it on European terrain?",AskHistorians

787,1708418033.0,How do historians view the Talmud’s ketubot 3b:1 in light of traditions at the time of Jesus’ birth?,">[Rabba](https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.3b.4?lang=bi&with=all) said: The baraita is referring to a period where the government said that a virgin who is married on Wednesday will submit to intercourse with the prefect [hegmon] first.

It’s my understanding that the Talmud (which this ketubot above is from) was originally an oral tradition that reaches a written form around the 5th Century CE (with the mishna component written circa 200 CE), but I frequently see Biblical scholars quoting the Talmud to support their assertions for traditions that existed in the First Century.

So, ketubot 3b:1 seems to codify the right of a foreign official to intercourse with an engaged Jewish virgin. The Gemara portion (the circa 500 CE portion) asks the Sages to issue a position that coercion must be claimed by the woman in this case, but the Sages decline to do so.

Wikipedia claims that this ketubot is  at the behest of an ancient Aramean (Hellenized Syrian) king, but on this specific point, I am still looking for an accessible primary source.  It’s interesting because the Elephantine Papyri includes a contract created in 449 BCE for a slave/handmaid named Tapamet who has an Aramean master
[Meshullam, son of Zakkur](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.12987/9780300249491-004/html) *and* she is engaged to a Jewish husband.

Around the time of the Elephantine Papyri, the ancient historian Herodotus (484-425 BCE), describes what he calls the Adyrmachidae on the Egyptian frontier:

>They are also the only tribe with whom the custom obtains of bringing all women about to become brides before the king, that he may choose such as are agreeable to him.

The earliest description of this rare practice seems to be the Epic of Gilgamesh, to whom these Adyrmachidae may have an association — both they and Giligammae are considered one people, the Marmaridae.

So, the Gospel of Luke is the one that contains the exposition on Mary and the Lord:

Luke 1:38
>Mary said, “Behold, the handmaid of the Lord…”

Every other instance in the Bible that I’m aware of, that uses the word handmaid or its original koine Greek word, doulē, refers to a handmaid in the sense that Bilpah and Zilpah are.

Additionally, the word Lord is also used for humans in the Bible.

>So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord is old…”

The use of the word Lord persists in the lesser-known Redditor, M’Lord.

I know I am including a lot of background information informing my question (as far as I understand it), the intention is to help the historian, and to be corrected on any part of it.  Encyclopedia Brittanica notes Semetic speakers as the first to be recorded to divinize humans, beginning with Sargon of Akkad and his grandson Narram-Sin: https://www.britannica.com/topic/sacred-kingship/The-divine-or-semidivine-king

By the time of the Mari Letters, it seems even some nomadic tribal patriarchs gain a measure of divinity. Abraham, called a lord in Genesis, seems to place on the spectrum of divinization in Jesus’ parable of Lazarus And The Rich Man, where it is Abraham in heaven that is appealed to?

Luke 16:24
>Then he cried and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me…’

I’ve mentioned this in previous questions but haven’t lucked into an answer yet (I know good responses can take time)  — there seem to be inscriptions worshipping the ancestor cult of [Obodas the God](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27926010)
that peak in the First Century in what’s now Israel. (The jstor link is to Jewish historian Avraham Negev of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in the Israel Exploration Journal.) Beyond that, Aretas IV’s coins seem to use Ancient Near East symbols of divine kingship, like the crescent crown. In other words, a subquestion could be, if Jesus was perceived as both human and a divine Lord, could Jesus’ biological father be perceived that way too, if he had an Abrahamic lineage ‘higher’ (like king of a confederacy of tribal kings) than tribal Davidic lineage?


For evidence of doulēs/handmaids in the era of the Gospels, First Century Jewish historian Josephus discusses the doulē of Herod the Great’s brother.

Different rabbis elsewhere in the Talmud discuss a short-term contract that also doesn’t disallow engaged women. The tone is different, it outlines rules for ancient Jewish women in mutually-agreeable, non-coercive, short-term contracts in [Yoma 18b](https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/318925) — entitled,  “A Bride For One Night”. It is only allowed with men of prominence.
A similar-sounding agreement (at least to my understanding) of nikah mu‘tah is only allowed among “People of the Book” in its original meaning, which seems to encompass everyone who spoke ancient Aramaic - Jewish, Arab, Christian, sometimes Zoroastrian (Persian), and possibly those practicing the astral religion of Haran (Wiki helped me out there.) In other words, the common thread seems to be Arameans.

And of course, the Biblical Israel/Jacob is an Aramean, per Deuteronomy 26:5

>You shall make this response before the Lord your God: ‘A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a great nation, mighty and populous.

To sum up, I’m looking for what historians think of in regards to naturalistic explanations for Jesus’ birth in the context of Ancient Near East custom and pageantry, especially any traveling, possibly intermittent, ancient Aramean-founded cultural influence.

789,1708416135.0,What were the qualifications in the various states to vote for delegates to the constitutional ratification conventions? ,"In Ch. 2, Founding Myths, in *Myth America*, Akhil Reed Amar briefly mentions that most states lifted typical property ownership qualifications on voting during the elections for delegates to the ratification conventions, pointing out specifically that in New York “all adult free male citizens could vote for convention delegates-no race tests, no property tests, no religious tests, no literacy tests” (pg 37). 

So how far did this extended franchise functionally extend? Did New York and other states with similarly broad convention franchise recognize free blacks as citizens and allow them to vote? How did was citizenship even defined pre-constitution? On its face it would seem this was possibly the most democratic election held, at least in New York, for decades, although I’m not familiar with the general development of the franchise in the early republic era and could be way off. I’d assume the lack of race tests didn’t extend to the south for obvious reasons, but just how expansive was the franchise for these ratification conventions? ",AskHistorians

He also takes steps to suggest, if not outright claim, that abolition in other civilizations began because of this unique moral opposition of the West to the practice.

Of course there are tons of differences - Vegas is still Vegas, & New York is still New York, in a sense - but the similarity struck me.

I'm sure each of these own processes are worth their own long expositions. But I was wondering what, if anything, they had in common?

850,1708367140.0,"Other than Caoanji Temple, what human institutions or traditions active today owe some traceable heritage to Manchaeism?","I'm well aware of Caoanji Temple in Fujian Province. When I first heard of it, the official word was that it had been completely converted into a Buddhist temple quite some time ago, but its caretakers were well aware of its past as the world's last Manichaean house of worship. Then I found articles and blog posts saying that the small number of families who've been associated with Caoanji for generations are in fact crypto-Manichaeans, with a thin veneer of Buddhism to distract attention from their difference, and from the CCP's dislike of religion in general. Not sure how reliable these reports are, though.

But for a religion that was definitely active, influential, and widespread until the late Middle Ages, I can't imagine there aren't other groups, societies, organizations, communities, projects, or companies that don't descend from groups that branched off from Manichaeanism, or merged with or absorbed one such group at some point in history. Or perhaps there's some institution around today that, while never explicitly Manichaean, was contemporary with and in great contact with Manichaeans, and absorbed a great deal of influence from them. The late Middle Ages is not really all that many generations ago, after all.",AskHistorians

1. they didn't have the same level of military hyper advantage the Mongols did who were a killing machine light years ahead of other armies.

They didn't have giant cities and consolidated empires yet they destroyed all of Persia and severely limited the byzantine presence in the middle east.

2. How were they able to maintain dominance in these areas for so long and how were indigenous religions like zoroastrianism, North African religions, christianity etc were wiped out so fast and never able to recover even till now? I guess only the glibal spread of Christianity comes close but it took them hundreds of years and colonialism where they were super empires miles ahead of everyone else.

It stated that the church's attitude towards the Jews was complicated because they were on the one hand sinners and on the other hand held a lot of influence on the crown because they had a monopoly over the slave trade (this was stated several times). At first I didn't take this too seriously as it was reminiscent of many untrue claims by antisemites in North America that claim that Jews had unproportional control over the slave industry in America. When I read more into it, however it seems possible that in South America (specifically in Colombia and Brazil), there was a higher percentage of Jews or Jewish descendants in the slave trade. The extent of what I found online  was that much of the slave trade was controlled by Portuguese merchants, and in parallel many Jewish exiles from Spain moved to Portugal and entered the trade business (including trade of slaves). I did not find any actual numbers however, just general references to the phenomenon and mentions of particular families. 
Let's assume that the museum referred to the slave trade in Colombia, or even just Cartagena. How true/feasible is the claim that Jews had a monopoly over the slave trade?

Edit: 

Just to provide some context, I'm Jewish and seeing this initially bothered me because it was something that potentially hundreds of people see everyday.

I've been reading about interwar period history recently and came across this event after looking up information about WWI veterans.  The plot was entirely revealed by Ret.

The initial media response involved widespread denial of its possibility while after the hearings the New York Times editorially confirmed a planned ""march on Washington"" that never materialized.  The plot has its assumed basis in a combination of WWI veteran dissatisfaction with the World War Adjusted Compensation Act (1924) leading to the formation of the [Bonus Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army) during the prior year and FDR's campaign promises being deemed too radical by conservative businessmen.

World War II was one of the most black and white wars in history and I don’t defend any of the Axis nations whatsoever.  

That being said, reading through the Wikipedia page on Italian Fascism, it’s easy to see why Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and even Soviet Russia would be seen as “evil” (for lack of a better term) countries, but I’m not seeing anything they did that was worse than what the other Allied nations were doing.  

Obviously their colonization efforts against Ethiopia were horrible and inhumane, but was it any worse than what the United Kingdom was doing to its colonies or the segregation, Japanese internment camps, and other horrible treatment of minorities that America was committing in its own citizens.

I ask this because WW2 is seen as a completely black and white war with clear good guys and bad guys, but it seems that as much as we vilify Fascist Italy, it’s hard seeing that what they were doing was any worse than the human rights violations that America and the UK were committing at the same time.

I know judging past nations’ morality is hard and not something historians generally do and ranking atrocities is generally in bad taste, but I’m not sure how else to ask this question.

949,1708280745.0,"When people say 'socialism', do they really mean 'marxism'? (Historical Question)","Maybe I am wrong about this but I want to understand. When people today say 'socialist' in the modern day, they are usually referring to a more well defined method of government characterised by centralisation, nationalisation, anticonsumerism, a lack of property, collectivism and stuff like that. But I thought that way of thinking about socialism was specifically marxist, coming from Marx's ideas on how the problem of capitalism should be solved which is why every characteristic I just listed applies to communism. I thought all of this was Marx's personal approach to socialism and therefore it's marxism.

You see, I understand socialism as a much broader movement of ideas that aren't necessarily to do with things like nationalisation and collectivism. I see 'socialism' as a term completely synonymous with 'anticapitalism'. When the liberal movement first began in the 18th century, people wanted to be liberated in every aspect of their lives including how they approached business because they didn't realise the huge problems caused by unregulated business. So capitalism was originally called 'liberalism' and this economic liberalism was a part of the larger political liberal movement. Not long after, a movement of people calling out the problems of a lack of economic regulation began to grow and this movement is known as 'socialism'.

And this is how I understand the term, as a broad movement holding many varying ideas on how to combat the problem of unregulated economics and business. I see Marxism as one man's ideas and approach to socialism that later began to define socialism because of the popularity of communism which I understand as a strictly defined method of government laid out by Marx and Engels.

So I see people's understanding of socialism as being based on and akin to communism and marxism. I see it this way because I have ideas about how to solve the problems with capitalism but they aren't necessarily reflective of marxist ideas but if I were to call my ideas 'socialist', people would immediately think about marxist ideas.

I see communism as a strictly defined method of government, marxism as the loose ideas and philosophies that Marx's communism is based on, and socialism as the broader movement of many differing ideas (about how to combat the capitalism) that later became naturally redefined in people's minds and vocabularies as a result of the immense popularity of communism and marxist thought.

Quesnel had been the leader of the Jansenists since Antoine Arnauld's death in 1694, and the papal bull ""Unigenitus"" in 1713 condemned as heretical 101 propositions in Quesnel's writings.

However, as its title implies, the text of this ""Miserere"" is strongly anti-Jansenist. Did Quesnel, possibly in response to the ""Unigenitus,"" recant his Jansenist views sometime before his death in 1719? I can't find any evidence that he did, but I also can't find any discussion of this work as a forgery misattributed to Quesnel, and falsely attributing a book to Quesnel while he was still alive to disavow it would have been a bold move.

The book has a long preface by a little-known Belgian pastor named Gerard Joseph Vander Meer (called by the epithet Tongrius because lived in Tongeren), so should we infer that Vander Meer was also the true author of the main text attributed to Quesnel?

The only other authorship I can find implied anywhere is on [this bibliographic website](https://www.cageweb.be/catalog?f%5Blanguage_facet%5D%5B%5D=fre&f%5Blibrary_facet%5D%5B%5D=GOP&f%5Bpub_date%5D%5B%5D=1714&per_page=15&q=&search_field=subject&sort=title_sort+asc%2C+pub_date_sort+desc) that lists Louis-Isaac Lemaistre de Sacy as the book's first author, ahead of Vander Meer and Quesnel, but that makes even less sense because de Sacy died in 1684.

961,1708275010.0,Why did France buy Corsica from Genoa?,"From what I know Genoa sold Corsica to France to pay off its debts. But what I would like to understand is why did France buy Corsica from Genoa in the first place? 

As I have stated before in another post the Mediterranean region declined in economic influence as a result of the discovery of new trade routes and the new world. And as far as I can tell at this point in history, Corsica offers no strategic value.

So why did France buy it in the first place?",AskHistorians

So I wonder, was there a lot of (small- or large-scale) crime around alcohol before the larger federal prohibition? I know early mafias first took root in the US during the 1910s, so maybe some of their business was centered around making money off of alcohol in dry states?",AskHistorians
963,1708270116.0,Was William I of England really a great guy?,"I am a 3rd year History student currently working on an assignment surrounding William I of England (Duke William II of Normandy) and i have been readings the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, William of Poitiers and William of Jumieges. For the most part, they speak of William quite highly and im yet to stumble on a primary source that does not make it seem like he was somewhat marvelous. But if you look at the devastation he caused during his reign, it leads me to question and i would love to hear others opinions on this. Why do the chroniclers speak so highly of him, is it out of fear they may fall victim to his wrath? Why if so many people were so unhappy is there very few accounts of this (that i can find anyways?) I am in no means an expert only seeking to further gain knowledge on William himself and what people's opinions were of him...but also if they were biased for any reason. If anyone could point me in the direction of any sources (primary or secondary) that discuss this it would be greatly appreciated! ",AskHistorians

965,1708268201.0,Did the narrative used to justify colonization and the othering of other cultures also negatively impact the possibility of lived diversity for British/western people?,"(As I'm not actually sure how well this question fits the sub, I'll also post on r/AskAnthropology.)

So this is basically just a thought I had and have not really read or heard anything related to this topic (and my internet search doesn't bring up much either).

When, for example, the colonizers talked about the otherness of other cultures/ethinicities in a derogatory way, did this also impact British society as they potentially tried to emphasize their superiority and distance themselves from the so-called ""primitive"" and ""uncivilized"" cultures. Did this potentially make the rules of society and what was acceptable more rigid in some way, repressing other forms of existence and maybe stalling progress in terms of tolerance? (While I'm thinking mostly about -what would today be called- queerness, neurodivergency, psychological issues/nuances and women not fitting the ""desired"" personality, please take this as referring to any other kind of differences as well.)

Or did the narrative maybe backfire in some other way? Would also love some resources (books, academic articles, etc.) to read more on the topic.

Of course I know that the basics of what was acceptable in British society go back much further, but I found this a fascinating thought and am wondering if there has been research done about this? (Or maybe I'm just completely off with this idea.)

Anyways, looking forward to any and all answers related to this topic!",AskHistorians
966,1708267861.0,"How did ancient and medieval leaders ""visualize"" a battle when planning it?","I was watching a video where an ancient warfare expert was rating movie scenes, and he mentioned that the trope of army leaders drawing a battle plan in the sand or on a map wasn't historical. He said that the ""top down"" image of a battle is a more modern idea because the capability to even see a battle that way or have a detailed map of it just wasn't possible in ancient times.

975,1708262450.0,How do civilizations adopt symbols and characteristics from other cultures? How do the people react/ adapt to these changes?,"I've quite recently developed an interest in the Hellenistic period and ptolemic egypt in the last few months, and I've discovered how religion is impacted by the communication and syncretism of two cultures. Especially graeco - egyptian figures (most prominently serapis) and also graeco - buddhism. 

But what intrigues me is did these changes and developments meet with resistance from the public? Or was it something that was originally brought in motion by them itself? And how really did these figures actually come to existence, how do cultures so easily (or not) adopt the practices of another religion and what exactly is the purpose behind this (is it political driven for the diplomatic relations between two nations)?

I thought perhaps the elites looked down on wealthy families from the frontier states as being too newly established, but that still doesn't make sense to me because the First Lady's family appears to have been notably wealthy for well over a century prior to her husband's Presidency. 

I'd never heard of this type of antiquated elitism before and was surprised considering the First Lady's genteel background. Are there any stronger sources to substantiate this and the reasoning behind it?",AskHistorians

It's a compelling narrative that makes for engaging storytelling but doesn't really do justice to the actual state of the Uranprojekt, be its disorganization or its entirely different development goals. At the very latest, the recordings at Farm Hall showed the shortcoming of the Uranprojekt. 

Between the Einstein–Szilard letter and Farm Hall, what is the earliest point at which someone in the US government (be it the Director of the OSS, head of the state department, someone within the Manhattan project or the president himself), have known or reasonably deducted that the German project wasn't gonna produce a working weapon and the arms race being one-sided?",AskHistorians

Media often depicts zealous and patriotic men signing up at the outbreak of war to fight for King and Country, and know WW1 encouraged “Pal Battalions” to volunteer. 

I wondered if this was a unique to the 1900s, or if at the outbreak of other wars, like Napoleonic or medieval kingdom wars, where on hearing the news that war broke out waves of civilians ran down to the recruiters. If not, why were the World Wars so different?

Crusades come to mind, but perhaps it was more the noble men that willingly flocked to the cross. ",AskHistorians
987,1708241553.0,Did Rasputin warn Tsar Nicholas II not go to war with Austria and Germany in WWI?,"In Episode 4 of the Netflix's docudrama The Last Czar, Rasputin was portrayed as being despondent about Russia's imminent declaration of war against The Central Powers and sent a telegram to Czarina Alexandra, telling her to persuade Tsar Nicholas to not go to war, as it would bring doom to Russia. Czarina then battled against Grand Duke Nicholasa (who was pro-war) for the Tsar's final decision on this. Did this really happen? How did Rasputin accurately predict Russia's and Nicholas's own demise due to the war? 

Also, later on, the docudrama portrayed Rasputin as the one advocating for Czarina Alexandra and her daughters to open a military hospital and work there, and told the Czarina that Tsar Nicholas had to be the one seen the people as leading the country, not Grand Duke Nicholasa. Did Rasputin actually have a good grasp about public relation and advocate all that? ",AskHistorians

I of course have some ideas but what like to hear other points of view and some history events in particular.

If my premise is hard to follow I could simplify it to: what differentiates capitalism or modern economics to all the systems that came before and what stopped us from reaching modern systems earlier?
