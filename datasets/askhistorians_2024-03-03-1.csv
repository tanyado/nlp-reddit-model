0,1609976180.0,META: Today's sedition at the United States Capitol is something unprecedented in American history,"Given the unprecedented events today and my contributions about the history of American elections on the forum over the last year, I've been asked by the mods here at /r/AskHistorians to write a little bit about how today's events might be viewed in the context of American history.  This is an unusual thread for unusual times, and I would ask for the understanding of those who might be inclined to immediately respond as if it were a normal Reddit political thread.  It isn't.

It's a real doozy, though, ain't it; I don't think any of us would have ever expected to see our fellow citizens nowadays storming Congress, disrupting the electoral process and carrying off rostrums.  But it's happened, and what I'll say to start is something simple: on the Federal level, this is indeed unprecedented.  Oh, you can certainly talk about the Civil War as an entirely different level of sedition, and varying attempts to suppress the franchise have been a constant theme from the beginnings of the Republic.  But this is the first time that the United States has not negotiated the transfer of power peacefully during a Presidential transition, and it's worth reviewing how it dodged the bullets in the past.

After the Election of 1800, Jefferson himself feared that the lame duck Federalist Congress would attempt to use the accidental deadlock in the Electoral College between him and Aaron Burr as justification to place one of their own as Acting President for the remainder of 1801 until the convening of the new Democratic Republican-controlled House in December.  There is evidence that he and others working on his behalf - namely the Democratic-Republican Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania - would have called out the militia to storm Washington to prevent this.  Fortunately, thanks to Federalist James Bayard of Delaware, this did not come to pass as Jefferson won the runoff, and the first peaceful transition of power in the United States resulted.

In 1876, the successful efforts by Republicans to shift 20 electoral votes from Democratic nominee Samuel Tilden to Republican nominee Rutherford Hayes during recounts in South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana produced threats of violence as well.  [George McClellan actively attempted to gain support in raising a militia to install Tilden, and in response to perceived threats of violence by him and others, then-President Grant reactivated Civil War forts surrounding Washington.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gppet5/after_the_us_elections_of_1876_i_understand_that/frp4dph/)  Fortunately, for reasons we are still unsure of, Tilden was lukewarm about the prospect, spent the first month writing legal briefs on the illegitimacy of the Hayes recount rather than politicking, and with numerous Southern Democrats already having reached a deal with Hayes' operatives to remove Federal troops from the South if he were to be elected, ultimately decided that he probably could not win even in the Democratic-controlled House and chose not to contest the election.  Again, a peaceful transition of power resulted.

This has not, however, been the case for large parts of American history on the state level.

In 1838, a gubernatorial election in Pennsylvania led to what has been called the ""Buckshot War.""  A gubernatorial election had ousted the incumbent Whig/Anti-Masonist by a slim margin of 5000 votes, both Democrats and Whigs claimed voter fraud (which both likely committed), and because of the resulting fights over who had won the state House elections in the districts that were disputed never resolved, two separate bodies claiming be the lawful Pennsylvania House of Representatives - one controlled by Whigs, the other Democrats - were formed.  This produced an interesting scene at the State House when, ""...before they began their separate deliberations, both groups attempted to occupy the physical building in which the official Pennsylvania House of Representatives was to meet, with some pushing and shoving as their two different speakers simultaneously took to the podium.""

Since both the state House and Senate were required to vote to declare the lawful winner, and the Senate was controlled by their party, Whigs had a path to retaining their governor if they managed to hold on to the House.  This led to a declaration by the Whig Secretary of State of Pennsylvania, Thomas Burrowes, that even for the times was remarkable: not only would he disallow the Democratic returns that were in dispute, but that members of his party should behave ""as if we had not been defeated"" since ""an honest count would put (their candidate) ahead by 10,000 votes.""  One historian has described this as ""a coup d'etat.""

This was made worse by the incumbent governor calling out the state militia, ostensibly to keep the peace but in reality to attempt to shut Democrats out.  Fortunately, state militia commander General Robert Patterson told the Governor directly that he would protect lives and property but under no terms would intervene in the conflict, ""“If ordered to clear the Capitol and install in the chair either or both of the Speakers, (I) would not do it.” Likewise, “if ordered to fire upon those [the Whigs] chose to call rebels, (I) would not do it [either].”  (His orders for his troops to arm themselves with buckshot gave the dispute its name.)  Frustrated, the Governor sent the militia home, requested federal troops, and received the following response from President Van Buren: ""To interfere in [this] commotion,” which “grows out of a political contest,” would have “dangerous consequences to our republican institutions.""

Ultimately, the conflict ended with three Whigs defecting and providing the Democratic side of the house a quorum to certify the election of the disputed Democrats and the Democratic governor, but the potential for bloodshed was very much real; in fact, while plotting with Burrowes for Whig control of both houses so he might gain election to the US Senate (this was in the days of legislatures electing Senators), Thaddeus Stevens was the subject of an assassination plot that resulted in both men escaping from a basement window in bare possession of their lives.

I don't have time currently to detail it all, but this was a pattern that repeated elsewhere many times during the 19th century.  Bashford against Barstow in Wisconsin in 1856 nearly got another militia battle, Bleeding Kansas and the bloody Lecompton pro-slave legislature in 1857 onwards outright previewed the Civil War, and Kentucky in 1899 had the Democratic candidate for governor outright assassinated in the midst of counting ballots.  Add in local disputes and the list gets longer; democracy has had very rough edges at times.

But I would urge you to take heart.  Even in chaos, today's United States is still not 1872 Louisiana, where something like 100 African Americans were brutally murdered at Colfax following a dispute over a gubernatorial election.  Nor is it 1876 South Carolina, where perhaps 150 were killed in pre-election violence where both Democrats and Republicans attempted to rig the election by shooting at each other.

Maybe it won't end up doing so at the Capitol, but Congress will convene, the election will be concluded, and the will of the people recognized.  We will learn and grow from it, move on, and create a more perfect union. 

Hang in there, folks.

Edit: A couple typos, and yes, as many have pointed Wilmington is one of those local events I was referring to that was equally as ugly as some of the ones I've mentioned on the state level.  See below for more!",AskHistorians
1,1591191488.0,George Floyd was murdered by America: a historian's perspective on the history of U.S. police brutality against Black people,"*From the /r/AskHistorians mod team*:

Multiple histories of US police violence against the Black community are being written this week. They’ve taken the form of tweet threads, news articles, blog posts, and conversations among friends, loved ones, and even strangers on the internet. Amidst these waves of information, we as historians want our readers to remember the following: 

Police brutality against Black people is woven into the fabric of the history of policing in the US—and reflects the historical reality that white America benefits from police and state violence against the Black community. George Floyd’s murder and the brutal suppression of the ensuing protests are the latest in a long history of police brutality and excessive, extraordinary violence. 

As historians like Edward Ayers and Sam Mitrani have established, the construct of American policing was formed between roughly 1840-1880 on the crest of two trends. First, rising population density in cities brought middle-class and wealthy white Americans into close contact with people they considered disruptive to their orderly world: sex workers, impoverished drunk people, Black residents, immigrants. Second, a spiralling urban trend towards wage labor for larger corporations that was itself a disruption in some of the institutions that had previously guarded local order, like families and close-knit neighborhoods.

From their establishment in the mid- to late-19th century, American police forces have depended on their mandate to keep or restore the white, wealthy ideal of order and the active support or tacit acceptance of this ongoing role by the majority of white Americans.

The history of lynching demonstrates this point with sickening clarity and is one we all should know. To highlight just one incident from the thousands that occured: a mob of white people dragged prosperous Black farmer Anthony Crawford from the Abbeville, South Carolina jail in full sight of the jailer and local sheriff on October 21, 1916. Crawford had been beaten and stabbed earlier that day; he was beaten again, possibly to death, hanged, and shot multiple times. His heinous crime? He accused a white man of trying to cheat him financially, and defended himself when a group of white men attacked him in response.

John Hammond Moore has offered that one motivation for the lynching was a rumor the sheriff was going to help Crawford escape and the white murderers believed the police presence was not doing its job of keeping order according to their definition of “order.” However, when the sheriff and jailer looked the other way, they delegated their role of keeping order to the mob, empowering them to act on their behalf.

In Crawford’s case, it is easy to connect the dots between white people affording police the responsibility to keep order, white people benefiting from white supremacy, and state participation in unjust violence, not least because of the direct involvement of white civilians. We can easily see Crawford’s lynching as part of an broader phenomenon, not just an individual, extraordinary event. In effect, the police did - and kept doing - what white people wanted. A decade later, the Illinois Crime Survey highlighted:

* The wildly disproportionate rate at which Black suspects were killed by Chicago police officers in comparison to the percentage of Black residents in the city
* That a suspect or criminal (of any race) is “a product of his surroundings in the slum areas in the same way in which the good citizen is a product of the lake front environment.” [[PDF](https://homicide.northwestern.edu/docs_fk/homicide/ICS/ICS.28.pdf)]

By the 1920s, research pioneered by women scholars at the University of Chicago was already highlighting how stereotypes around “slum environment” turned residents into perceived criminals. They observed that the Black neighborhoods defined as ""slums"" exhibited precisely the same ""disorderly"" characteristics that had spurred the creation of official police departments in the previous century. And they observed how these conditions were the result of pervasive, systemic white supremacy. 

Additionally, social workers documented how school segregation and the massive underfunding of Black schools by city politicians contributed to those same conditions, creating a feedback loop; The disorder the police were approved to combat was created by the lack of funding and resources. The ideal of order that the majority of white Chicagoans found attractive, in other words, both justified and resulted from police violence against their Black neighbors.

The nature of a survey, like the Illinois Crime Survey, demonstrates the same thing we recognize in lynching: individual cases of state violence against Black Americans, whatever the specific circumstances, are part of a pattern. But while the specter of lynching haunts the fringes of American crime, the pattern of police brutality against the Black community has not let up. In 2015, Jamil Smith showed how the final moments of some many of those killed by police across the decades echoed each other, again and again. 

From the Fugitive Slave Act to George Floyd, examples of police violence against Black Americans are endless, gruesome, and there for everyone to see and behold. In 1942, Private Thomas Foster was beaten and shot four times by Little Rock police officers after intervening to stop the assault of a fellow soldier. In 1967, a cab driver named John William Smith was savagely beaten by the Newark police. In 1984, New York City police officers shot Eleanor Bumpurs multiple times as they tried to evict her, making the call that getting her out of her apartment was more important than accommodating her mental health struggles. We could list hundreds, if not thousands, further such examples that illustrate this pattern.

But it’s not enough to say, “here are a bunch of examples of police officers brutalizing Black people.” The ability of individual officers to assault and kill Black Americans year after year, decade after decade, murder after murder, stems from the unwillingness of the white majority to step beyond protesting individual cases or do to more than stroke our chins and say, “Yes, I see a pattern.”

That pattern exists because despite every act of police brutality, and even despite protests following individual acts, white America’s preference for an ""orderly"" society has been a higher priority. From the inception of official police forces in the mid-19th century, to school truancy officers and border patrol, the American police have existed at the will of the white majority to keep and restore order, as defined by the white majority, using the ""necessary"" force, as defined by the mostly white police force and legal system.

When we come to write the history of the last few days, we need to remember this wider context and that it goes beyond any single member of the police.  It is not that every officer is evil, but they do operate in a system which was designed to build and maintain white supremacy. Justice for the individual Black Americans killed by individual members of the police is necessary, but so is a long, hard look at - and action against - our understanding of societal order and how it must be upheld. 

Exposing these structures has taken years of untold work and sacrifice on the part of Black communities, activists and historians. It is far past time that white Americans help rather than hinder this work.

3,1591144199.0,AskHistorians is closing to new posts from 8:30 PM EDT to 12 PM EDT tomorrow to protest the reddit admins' providing a home for hate speech.,"AskHistorians is not accepting new posts or responses, in protest against Reddit’s lack of action against racism and hate on the site.

Reddit has announced [its alignment with antiracist protesters](https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106?s=20). We demand to know: where are the actions to back up the words? The Reddit administrators’ policies have made their site downright hospitable to exactly the kinds of racists and fascists against whom it claims to be protesting. 

Every day our sub, which has zero tolerance for such speech, has to remove the kinds of intensely problematic and hateful rhetoric that Reddit has become a safe haven for. For example, questions and answers supporting Holocaust denial forced us to establish a clear policy of immediate deletion, as moderator /u/commiespaceinvader describes [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/slate.com/technology/2018/07/the-askhistorians-subreddit-banned-holocaust-deniers-and-facebook-should-too.amp).

Reddit has few such qualms. Most recently, the admins' recent attempt to force unmoderated chatrooms on every community would have circumvented our rules and allowed our sub to become just the platform for allowing hate speech that we work every day to prevent—reflecting the admins’ concern for their bottom line above all else. It was subreddits, including AskHistorians, whose protests of that decision made Reddit rescind this particular move towards allowing hate speech.

The /r/AskHistorians mod team has also issued a statement on state violence and white supremacy: [George Floyd was murdered by America: a historian's perspective on the history of U.S. police brutality against Black people](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gvu38i/george_floyd_was_murdered_by_america_a_historians/)

Reddit’s stance is hypocritical. It leaves us no choice but to protest.

----------

Over a year ago, the Admins rolled out chat rooms. It was on an opt-in basis, allowing moderators to decide whether their communities would have them or not. We were told we would always have this control.

Today, that promise was broken, and in the worst way possible. With no forewarning, and [one very hidden announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/gacdqy/new_start_chatting_feature_on_reddit/) *not* in the normal channels where such information is announced to mods, the Admins rolled out chat rooms on all subreddits, even those which have purposefully kept chatrooms disabled for various reasons, be it simply a lack of interest, viewing them as not fitting the community vision, or in other cases, covering subject matter they simply don't believe to be appropriate for chat rooms.

But these chat rooms are being done as an end-around of those promises, and entirely without oversight of the moderators whose communities they are being associated with. At the top of our subreddit is an invitation to ""*Find people in /r/AskHistorians who want to chat*"". This is false advertising though. The presentation by the Admins implies that the chat rooms are affiliated with our subreddit, which is in no way true.

They are not run according to our rules, whether those for a normal submission, or the more light-hearted META threads. We have no ability whatsoever to moderate them, and in fact, it is a de facto unmoderated space entirely, as the Admins have made clear that *they* will be moderating these chat rooms, which is troubling when it can sometimes take over a week to get a response on a report filed with them.

As Moderators, we are unpaid volunteers who work to build a community which reflects our values and vision. In the past, we have always been promised control over shaping that community by the site Admins, and despite missteps at points, it is a promise we have trusted. Clearly we were wrong to do so, as this has broken that trust in a far worse way than any previous undesired feature the Admins have thrust upon us, lacking *any* control or say in its existence, even as it seeks to leverage the unique community we have spent many years building up.

We unfortunately have very few tools available to us to protest, but we certainly refuse to abide quietly by this unwanted and unwelcome intrusion into the space we have worked to build. As such, we are using one of the few measures which is available to us, and will be turning the subreddit private for one hour at 8:30 PM EDT. 

This is *not* a permanent decision by any means. It will be returned to visible for all users one hour from the start, 9:30 PM EDT, but this is one of the very few means available to us to stress to the Admins how seriously we take this, and how deeply troubled we are by what they are doing.

We deeply thank our community members for their understanding of the decision we have taken here, and for everything they have done to help shape this community as it has grown over the years.

5,1594452525.0,Askhistorians has a policy of zero tolerance for genocide denial,"The Ask Historians moderation team has made the commitment to be as transparent as possible with the community about our actions. That commitment is why we offer [Rules Roundtables](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/faq/meta#wiki_rules_discussion) on a regular basis, why we post explanations when removing answers when we can, and why we send dozens of modmails a week in response to questions from users looking for feedback or clarity. Behind the scenes, there is an incredible amount of conversation among the team about modding decisions and practices and we work hard to foster an environment that both adheres to the standards we have achieved in this community and is safe and welcoming to our users.

One of the ways we try to accomplish this is by having a few, carefully crafted and considered zero-tolerance policies. For example, we do not tolerate racist, sexist, homophobic, ableist, or antisemitic slurs in question titles and offer users guidance on using them in context and ask for a rewrite if there’s doubt about usage. We do not tolerate users trying to doxx or harass members of the community. And we do not tolerate genocide denial. 

At times, genocide denial is explicit; a user posts a question challenging widely accepted facts about the Holocaust or a comment that they don’t think what happened to Indigenous Americans following contact with Europeans was a genocide. In those cases, the question or comment is removed and the user is permanently banned. If someone posts a question that appears to reflect a genuine desire to learn more about genocide, we provide them a carefully written and researched answer by an expert in the topic. But at other times, it’s much less obvious than someone saying that a death toll was fabricated or that deaths had other causes. Some other aspects of what we consider genocide denial include:

* Putting equal weight on people revolting and the state suppressing the population, as though the former justifies the latter as simple warfare
* Suggesting that an event academically or generally considered genocide was “just” a series of massacres, etc.
* Downplaying acts of cultural erasure considered part of a genocide when and if they failed to fully destroy the culture

Issues like these can often be difficult for individuals to process as denial because they are often parts of a dominant cultural narrative in the state that committed the genocide. North American textbooks for children, for instance, may downplay forced resettlement as simply “moving away”. Narratives like these can be hard to unlearn, especially when living in that country or consuming its media.

When a question or comment feels borderline, the mod who notices it will share it with the group and we’ll discuss what action to take. We’ve recently had to contend with an uptick in denialist content as well as with denialist talking points coming from surprising sources, including members of the community. We have taken the appropriate steps in those cases but feel the need to reaffirm our strong stance against denial, even the kind of soft denial that is frequently employed when it comes to lesser known instances of genocide, such as “it happened during the course of a war” or “because disease was involved no campaign of extermination took place.”

We once again want to reaffirm our stance of zero tolerance for the denial of historical atrocities and our commitment to be open about the decisions we, as a team of moderators, take.

I was shocked out how versatile this plant was-- the leaves were edible, the roots could be roasted as a coffee substitute, the milky sap inside the stem was said to have medicinal properties, and the flower tops could even be bottled and made into wine!

AH members help with the Moderator Reserves project, sit on council meetings and phone calls, host Reddit administrators who want to shadow moderators, and participate in surveys. Due to our commitment to the subreddit, we’ve built positive relationships with many admins who have been open to our feedback. But over the last couple of days—most notably during [Spez’s AMA](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/)—it’s become clear to us that Reddit’s leadership is not interested in finding common ground; rather, it seems to us like they're hell-bent on pursuing a course that damages us and them alike.

**We feel we are left with no choice but to join the protest. On June 12, starting at 7am ET, we will take our sub private. We will remain private on June 13 as well.**

We’ll open the sub again on June 14th but will pause participation. This means you will be able to access existing content, such as the [Trans History Megathread in Celebration of Pride Month](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/141fhrs/trans_history_megathread_in_celebration_of_pride/), but will not be able to ask or answer questions. We will be delaying or holding off AMAs, limiting our newsletter, and will not be recording any new podcast episodes. As of today, we do not know how long this pause will last.

We cannot put this letter out into the world without thanking you for the immense support you’ve shown us over the last week. We’ve received support across platforms, in public and in private. We’ve been a community for nearly 12 years and that would not have happened without you and our other 1.8 million subscribers. We know we’re not the easiest community to post in, and deeply appreciate the people who ask dozens of thoughtful, rule-abiding questions every day, the people joining in on April Fools Day, those who anonymously report trolls and low effort answers, support the podcast via Patreon, and those who provide honest, thoughtful feedback on how we’re faring in general. We don’t take lightly the idea of shutting down this place and the community that we all build together, and we understand how frustrating it will be to not be able to find out, for example, [why GPS is free](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/13y7ee7/why_is_gps_free/).

15,1513441938.0,Why are elementary-aged students in the US knowingly taught a version of US History that middle and high schools have to completely contradict and reexplain?,"I’ve always wondered why so many of the lessons about history (especially US history) taught during the early years of my education (late ‘90s and early ‘00s) were based on myths or tall tales that all my later teachers would have to completely negate. Stuff along the lines of “Columbus proved the Earth was round” or “Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity” or portraying the Founding Fathers as saintly heroes with no room for complexity/flaws.

I’m not suggesting that 5-10 year olds should be exposed to the ugliest/most disturbing parts of our history for the sake of total accuracy, or that such young minds should be expected to grasp all the complexities of real history. But why are so many of these demonstrably false stories taught to young students as fact?

EDIT: Some of the early replies have called into question whether I am misremembering that these stories were really TAUGHT as fact rather than merely told as stories. I won’t reject that possibility with regard to some of the specific examples I provided, but I certainly have many memories of history teachers (from around 6th grade on) having to dispel similar generalizations and falsehoods when reintroducing familiar topics. If the dissemination of bad history like this isn’t due to early education, it would still be interesting to know why/how it became so widespread as to require dispelling at all.",AskHistorians

17,1490019081.0,UPDATE: The Trump Administration and the National Endowment for the Humanities,"Hi, folks:

You might have missed it in the flood of political news lately, but [President Trump's budget proposal](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/arts/nea-neh-endowments-trump.html?_r=0) proposes to defund the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (which helps fund PBS and NPR stations).

You may recall that we [ran a previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5r1dlk/the_trump_administration_and_the_national/) on this topic when the proposal was just a rumor, but now that it's an official proposal we decided to update this and ask you to take action. 

The mission of /r/Askhistorians is to provide high-quality historical answers to a wide audience. We usually work online, through [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/askhistorians), [our Tumblr account](http://askhistorians.tumblr.com/), and here, but that's not all we do. [We talk to historians and bring them here for AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/amas). We have (with your help) [presented at historical conferences](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/february-2016/have-a-question-about-the-past-askhistorians). We also advocate: for good history, for civil discussion, and for keeping historical research going.

That's what we're doing today, and we need your help. 

We don't get political for a particular candidate, a particular party, or a particular point of view. We get political when good history matters. **If you're American, we're asking you to call your Congressmen and Congresswomen to support funding for the NEA and NEH.**

The federal budget process isn't fast, and it isn't straightforward, but it *is* changeable. Each February, when the president submits his or her budget to Congress, there's a better chance of a cow getting through a slaughterhouse untouched than that budget staying in the same form. That's why your calls matter: Congress catches a lot of flak, but it does do work, particularly in the details of the budget.

And we say *call*, not email, because calls matter. It's easy to ignore an email; you probably do it a few times on any given day. It's a lot harder to ignore a phone call. [Call your Senators and Congresswoman](https://www.govtrack.us/). You won't talk to them directly; you'll talk to a staffer or an intern answering phones. They've been getting a lot of calls lately. Chances are, they'll have a local office as well as their DC office. If you can't get through to one, try the other.

Don't call other Congressmen than your own. It's a waste of time. Don't follow a script; those tend to get ignored. Just say who you are, where you're calling from (city/zip code, if you don't want to give your address), and what you're calling about.

Repetition helps. Put the numbers in your cellphone and give 'em a call when you're headed to work or have a spare minute or two. It doesn't take a lot of time, but it can make a world of good.

Why are you calling?

The National Endowment for the Humanities funds a lot of good things. If you've seen Ken Burns' documentary *The Civil War,* you've seen some of its work. If you've read *Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-45*, you've seen some of its work. If you've visited your local museum, chances are that it too received some NEH funding.

There's something else important: **NEH funding indirectly supports what you're reading right now.**

Many of our moderators, flaired commentators and even ordinary users have jobs that are funded in part or wholly by NEH grants. They have the spare time to offer their knowledge and skills here because of those grants. A lot of the links we provide in our answers exist because of the NEH. [The *Discovering America* digital newspaper archive is supported by the NEH.](https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/)

The NEH does all of that with just $143 million per year in federal funding. That's just 0.003 percent of the federal budget. If you make $40,000 a year and spent that much of your income, you'd be spending $1.20.

For all the NEH does, that's a good deal.

> If you're making a call for NEA/NEH, please also take a moment to mention [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/news-events/news-releases/institute-museum-and-library-services-issues-statement-presidents-proposed) which is also on the block, and to be crude, odds are better you'll personally be impacted by it's loss more quickly than any of the other federal humanities funding. IMLS funding is of particular importance to rural libraries and Native American museums and libraries, and can sometimes be the bulk of funding at those libraries. But if you're a patron of smaller public library, your library probably only got the Internet because of an IMLS grant, because that was their largest grant impact during the 90s-00s. It's a quiet, effective and responsible distributor of tiny amounts of federal money, that have nevertheless had an out-sized impact on the quality of public library services available in America.

22,1686092015.0,AskHistorians and uncertainty surrounding the future of API access,"**Update June 11, 2023: We have decided to join the protest. Read the announcement [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/146xzgk/meta_tomorrow_askhistorians_will_go_private/?).**

On [April 18, 2023, Reddit announced it would begin charging for access to its API](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/technology/reddit-ai-openai-google.html). Reddit faces real challenges from free access to its API. Reddit data has been used to train large language models that underpin AI technologies, such as ChatGPT and Bard, which matters to us at AskHistorians because technologies like these make it quick and easy to violate our rules on plagiarism, makes it [harder for us to moderate](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jg5qy8/reddit-moderators-brace-for-a-chatgpt-spam-apocalypse), and could erode the trust you have in the information you read here. Further, access to archives that include user-deleted data violates your privacy. 

However, make no mistake, **we need API access to keep our community running.** We use the API in a number of ways, both through direct access and through use of archives of data that were collected using the API, most importantly, Pushshift. For example, we use API supported tools to:

* Find answers to previously asked questions, including answers to questions that were deleted by the question-asker
* Help flairs track down old answers they remember writing but can’t locate
* Proactively identify new contributors to the community 
* Monitor the health of the subreddit and track how many questions get answers. 
* Moderate via mobile (when we do) 
* Generate [user profiles](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles) 
* Automate posting themes, trivia, and other special events
* Semiautomate /u/gankom’s massive [Sunday Digest](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ADigest) efforts 
* Send the newsletter 

Admins have promised minimal disruption; however, over the years they’ve made a number of promises to support moderators that they did not, or could not follow up on, and at times even reneged on:  

* In 2015, in response to widespread protests on the sub, the [admins promised they would build tools and improve communication with mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/). 
* In 2019 the admins promised that chat would always be an opt-in feature. However, a year later an unmoderated chat feature was made a [default feature on most subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gakw51/in_30_minutes_at_830_pm_edt_raskhistorians_will/) 
* In [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gvji7z/askhistorians_is_closing_to_new_posts_from_830_pm/), in response to moderators protesting racism on Reddit,  admin promised to support mods in combating hate 
* [In 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/vaxxhappened/comments/pbe8nj/we_call_upon_reddit_to_take_action_against_the/), again, in response to protests, Reddit’s admin promised a feature to report malicious interference by subreddits promoting Covid denial. 

Reddit’s admin has certainly made progress. In 2020 they [updated the content policy to ban hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/ ) and in 2021 they [banned and quarantined communities promoting covid denial](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/). But while the company has updated their policies, they have not sufficiently invested in moderation support. 

**Reddit admins have had 8 years to build a stronger infrastructure to support moderators but have not.** 

API access isn’t just about making life easier for mods. It helps us **keep our communities safe** by providing important context about users, such as whether or not they have a history of posting rule-violating content or engaging in harmful behavior. The ability to search for removed and deleted data allows moderators to more quickly respond to spam, bigotry, and harassment. On AskHistorians, we’ve used it to help identify accounts that spam ChatGPT generated content that violates our rules. If we want to mod on our phones, **third party apps** offer the most robust mod tools. Further, third party apps are particularly important for moderators and users who rely on screen readers, [as the official Reddit app is inaccessible to the visually impaired](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13zbf3n/reddit_to_the_visually_impaired_you_no_longer/). 

Mods need API access because Reddit doesn’t support their needs. 

We are highly concerned about the downstream impacts of this decision. Reddit is built on volunteer moderation labour that costs other companies [millions of dollars per year](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/technology/facebook-accenture-content-moderation.html). While some tools we rely on [may not be technically impacted](https://www.reddit.com/r/toolbox/comments/141locs/announcement_reddits_upcoming_api_changes_and/), and some may return [after successful negotiations](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/13w6j20/advancing_communityled_moderation_an_update_on/), the ecosystem of API supported tools is vast and varied, and the tools themselves require volunteer labour to maintain. Changes like these, particularly the poor communication surrounding them, and cobbled responses as domino after domino falls, year after year, risk making r/AskHistorians a worse place both for moderators and for users—there will likely be more spam, fewer posts helpfully directing users to previous answers to their questions, and our ability to effectively address trolling, and [JAQing off](https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/the-askhistorians-subreddit-banned-holocaust-deniers-and-facebook-should-too.html) will slow down.

...

**Osama bin Laden and the formation of al-Qaeda**

To best contextualize the events of the day, we’re going to start with Osama bin Laden. His father, billionaire Mohammed bin Laden, was one of the richest men in Saudi Arabia. Mohammed made his wealth from a construction empire but died when Osama was only 10, leaving behind 56 children and a massive fortune. The prominence of the family name and wealth are two important factors for understanding Osama's rise to power.

The bin Ladens were generally Westernized and many members of the family frequently travelled or sought out education outside Saudi Arabia. Osama bin Laden, however, was upset at Saudi Arabia's close ties with the West and was more attracted to religious practices. The relationship between Saudi Arabia and the US was established in the 1940s when FDR signed a deal with King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, essentially giving the US primary access to oil in exchange for support and — essential to this history — defense from the US military.

Osama bin Laden went to college at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in the late 70s. After graduating, he traveled to Afghanistan to help the freedom fighters — known as the mujahedeen — in their battle against the Soviets, who had invaded in 1979. Unlike some young men who joined the battles in Afghanistan and took a ""summer camp"" approach, spending a few months in training before going back to their home countries, Osama was a true believer. He stayed and committed to the fight. He used his leverage as a son of Mohammad bin Laden and his large yearly financial allowance to smooth over initial troubles integrating into the group. (Note: The United States, though the CIA, also were funding the Afghan freedom fighters against the Soviets. The funding didn’t end until 1992, long after Osama bin Laden had left -- the two were not affiliated.)

The group al-Qaeda intended as a more global organization than the mujahideen, was founded in 1988 in order to further Islamic causes, Osama played a role in funding and leading from its inception. The Soviets withdrew the year after, and Osama bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia a hero, having helped bring down a superpower. Potentially rudderless, he was energized in the summer of 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. This event kicked off what is known as the Gulf War. Given Kuwait was adjacent to Saudi Arabia, and the enduring close relationship between the kingdom and the US  — hundreds of thousands of US troops were mobilized and housed in Saudi Arabia, with Saudi Arabia footing most of the bill.

Osama bin Laden tried to pitch the fighters trained up from their years in Afghanistan as being up to the task of defending Kuwait as opposed to calling in the Americans, but his plea was rejected by the Saudi government (Note: to be fair, it is unlikely his force was large enough to handle the Iraqi military, the fourth largest military in the world at the time). This rejection, combined with the fact the US lingered for several years after the Gulf War ended, diverting resources from the Saudi Arabian people directly to the Americans, made an impression on Osama.

He vocally expressed disgust, and given that the Saudi Royal Family did not tolerate dissent, soon left the country for Sudan (which had just had an Islamist coup) in 1991. Even from another country, Osama kept up his public disdain for Saudi Arabia; family members pleaded with him to stop, but he didn’t and eventually, he was kicked out for good: his citizenship was revoked.

Meanwhile, he  kept close contact with various terrorist groups — Sudan was a hub — and used the wealth he still possessed to build farming and construction businesses.

His public resentment for the United States continued, and as he was clearly a power player, the CIA successfully pressured the leadership of Sudan into kicking Osama bin Laden out in 1997; his assets were confiscated and he started anew in Afghanistan, finding safe shelter with the ruling Taliban, a political movement and military force. The Taliban had essentially taken control of the country by 1996, although the civil war was still ongoing. Almost immediately after he arrived, bin Laden made a ""declaration of war"" against the US. He later explained: 

>We declare jihad against the United States because the US Government is an unjust, criminal, and abusive government.

He objected to the US occupying Islam’s holy places (which included the Gulf War occupation), and had specific grievance with the US's continued support of Israel and the Saudi royals. For him, it was clearly  not just a religious matter, but also personal and political.

Earlier that same year, the CIA established a special unit, based in Tysons Corner, Virginia, specifically for tracking Osama bin Laden They searched for a reason to bring charges, and finally had a break when Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl (code named ""Junior""), one of the first to give allegiance to Osama, approached the Americans. He had stolen $100,000 from Osama and needed protection. In return, he offered details about organizational charts and most  importantly, a way to connect Osama to  the Black Hawk Down incident in Mogadishu in 1993. The CIA was working to gather enough evidence such that if the opportunity presented itself, he could be taken into custody for conspiring to attack the United States.

Meanwhile, the CIA worked to raise alarms among the military and intelligence communities. When George W. Bush won the presidency in 2000 and first met Clinton at the White House, Clinton said

>I think you will find that by far your biggest threat is bin Laden and the al-Qaeda. 

Some of the events that led to that assessment included the 1996 al-Qaeda-led attempted assassination plot on US President Bill Clinton while he was in Manila. (The Secret Service were  alerted and agents found a bomb under a bridge). In 1998,  al-Qaeda orchestrated attacks on US embassies in Africa that led to the deaths of hundreds. Then in 2000, they were responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole (suicide bombers in a small boat went alongside the destroyer, killing 17 crew members).

By the time the warning about Al-Qaeda was shared with Bush, plans for what would later become known as 9/11 were well underway. The plan was put into motion when, in the summer of 2000, a number of Al-Qaeda members took up flight training in the United States. Final decisions, including target selection, were probably made in July 2001, when the terrorists’ field commander, Mohamed Atta, traveled to Spain for a meeting with his friend and now coordinator: Ramzi bin al-Shibh. The nineteen hijackers were divided into four groups, each with a certified pilot who would be able to guide the airliners into their targets plus three or four enforcers whose job it was to ensure that the terrorist pilot was able to successfully carry out his task. The hijacking itself was easy enough. The terrorists used utility knives and pepper spray to subdue the flight attendants and passengers.

Before we go into the specifics of what happened on September 11, 2001, we want to address the idea of a “20th hijacker.” Tactically, it  makes sense to have equal teams of 5 men. While the identity of the would-be 20th hijacker has never been confirmed (nor has the reason for his dropping out of the operation been established), circumstances indicate he did exist and numerous hypotheses as to who the man was have been proposed. (The most prominent — Zacarias Moussaoui, who was convicted in federal court of conspiracy to commit terrorism — later said he was supposed to be involved in a different terrorist attack, after September 11th.)

**September 11, 2001**

Early in the morning of 9/11 four airliners took off from airports in the US East Coast: two Boeing 757s and two Boeing 767s, two of American Airlines and two of United Airlines. All four planes were scheduled to fly to California, on the US West Coast, which meant they carried a  large fuel load. The hijackers knew that once they redirected to their targets, they would still have most of that fuel. The two planes that struck the WTC towers had been in the air for less than an hour.

American Airlines Flight 11 hit the North Tower and United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center, in New York City. Both impacts damaged the utility shaft systems and jet fuel spilled down elevator shafts and ignited, crashing elevators and causing large fires in the lobbies of the buildings. Both buildings collapsed less than two hours later. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), tasked by the US Congress with investigating the cause of the buildings’ collapse, reported portions of the buildings reached 1000 degrees centigrade. (Note: Not only was jet fuel burning, so were desks, curtains, furniture, and other items within the WTC  While some like to point out this is under the ""melting point"" of steel [1510 centigrade],  this detail is absolutely irrelevant: the steel did not liquify. Consider the work of a blacksmith; they do not need to melt steel in order to bend it into shape. Steel starts to weaken at around 600 centigrade, and 1000 centigrade is sufficient to cause steel to lose 90% strength, so there was enough warping for both buildings to entirely lose their integrity.)

A third, nearby tower was damaged by debris from the collapse of the other towers, causing large fires that compromised the building’s structural integrity. Internally, ""Column 79"" buckled, followed by Columns 80 and 81, leading to a progressive structural collapse where, as the NIST report puts it, ""The exterior façade on the east quarter of the building was just a hollow shell."" This led to the core collapsing, followed by the exterior. (Note: There is a conspiracy theory related to a conversation the real estate developer Larry Silverstein, and owner of the building, had with the fire department commander. He was heard saying, ""We've had such a terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it."" However, this is common firefighter terminology and simply refers to pulling out firefighters from a dangerous environment.)

At 9:37 AM, the terrorist piloting American Airlines Flight 77 struck the Pentagon. The plane first hit the ground, causing one wing to disintegrate and the other to shear off. The body of the plane then hit the first floor, leaving a hole 75 feet wide. Things could have been much worse: the portion of the Pentagon hit was undergoing renovation so had a quarter of the normal number of employees; additionally, while 26 of the columns holding up the second floor were destroyed, it took half an hour before the floor above collapsed. This meant all of the people on the 2nd through 5th floors were able to safely escape. Meanwhile, the Pentagon itself is mostly concrete as it was built during WWII, while steel was being rationed. The steel that was used turned out to be placed in fortuitously beneficial ways. The pillars had been reinforced with steel in a spiral design (as opposed to hoops) and the concrete pillars were reinforced with overlapping steel beams. 

Note: There is a conspiracy theory that the Pentagon was struck by a missile rather than a plane. This is absurd for numerous reasons, one being the hundreds who saw the plane as it approached the Pentagon (some observers even recognized the plane’s livery as belonging to American Airlines.) Second, nearly all the passengers from the flight were later identified by DNA testing. Third, one of the first responders, a structural engineer, said

>I saw the marks of the plane wing on the face of the stone on one side of the building. I picked up parts of the plane with the airline markings on them. I held in my hand the tail section of the plane, and I stood on a pile of debris that we later discovered contained the black box.… I held parts of uniforms from crew members in my hands, including body parts. Okay?

The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed into a field in rural Pennsylvania. The passengers on the plane were able to overwhelm the enforcers and break into the cockpit.  The crash caused no structural damage, and took no lives, on the ground. 

We now need to rewind to what was happening immediately following the hijacking of the four planes. Controversy surrounds the immediate response of the US military to the attacks, with questions about why the airliners were not shot down (or, conversely, could they have legally been shot down.) In the end, the military response was stifled by communications chaos and the fact that by and large the terrorists did not leave enough time for a comprehensive reaction. The first fighters, F-15C Eagles from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts, were scrambled after the first tower had already been hit. By the time Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy and Major Daniel Nash reached New York, the other WTC tower had been struck. Nash would later recall:

> I remember shortly after takeoff you could see the smoke because it was so clear: the smoke from the towers burning. . . . And then we were about 70 miles out when they said, ‘a second aircraft has hit the World Trade Center.’

An additional three fighters took to the air from Langley AFB in Virginia, at 0930. With just seven minutes left before American 77 would hit the Pentagon, the Langley jets would have been hard pressed to make it in time to see the impact, let alone to prevent it. In the end, it made no difference that in the initial confusion, they first  flew away from DC. Finally, two F-16s, those of Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney, took off from Andrews Air Force Base at 1042. Their task was  to intercept and destroy any hijacked airliner that might attempt to enter DC airspace. The rapidity of the order, however, meant that the F-16s were sent out unarmed. As a result, both pilots were acutely aware that their orders were, essentially, to commit suicide. They would have had to ram the incoming B757, with Sasseville ordering Penney to strike the tail while he would strike the nose. The chances of a successful ejection would have been minuscule. 

Note: modern airliners are very good at staying in the air even when not fully functional and are designed with a potential engine failure in mind. As a result, any plan hinging on “just damage and disable one of the engines” (for example, by striking it with the vertical stabilizer) carried unacceptable risk of failure: the fighter jet would have been destroyed either way, but while the pilot would have a better chance of surviving, Flight 93 could have continued on its way. Therefore, ramming the fuselage was the only method of attack which would have given a near-certainty of the B757 being stopped there and then.

Further reports and inquiries, including the 9/11 Commission, revealed a stupefying degree of chaos and cover-ups at the higher levels of command on the day of the attacks. While “fog of war” was certainly a factor, and the FAA’s failure to communicate with NORAD exacerbated the chaos, the timeline of events later published by NORAD contradicted established facts and existing records and became a paramount example of a government agency trying to avoid blame for their errors throughout the sequence of events described here. Members of the 9/11 Commission identified these contradictions and falsehoods as a leading cause of conspiracy theories regarding the attacks.

**What happened after**

The aftermath, which is beyond the scope of this post, was global. Sympathy and unity came from nearly all corners of the world; a response of force was authorized by the US on September 18, 2001:

>That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such  nations, organizations or persons.

The joint US-British effort to eliminate the Taliban began on October 7, with France, Germany, Australia, and Canada also pledging support. Ground forces arrived in Afghanistan 12 days later, but most of the fighting happened between the Taliban and the Afghan rebels, who had been fighting against the Taliban all this time. The international support led to a quick sweep over Taliban strongholds in November: Taloqan, Bamiyan, Herat, Kabul, Jalalabad. The Taliban collapsed entirely and surrendered Kandahar on December 9th.

In December 2001, Osama bin Laden was  tracked to caves southeast of Kabul, followed by an extensive firefight against the al-Qaeda led by Afghan forces. He  escaped on December 16, effectively ending the events of 2001.

>We have entered the third millennium through a gate of fire. If today, after the horror of 11 September, we see better, and we see further — we will realize that humanity is indivisible. New threats make no distinction between races, nations or regions. A new insecurity has entered every mind, regardless of wealth or status. A deeper awareness of the bonds that bind us all — in pain as in prosperity — has gripped young and old.

77,1616260995.0,The Atlanta-Area Murders Were Racially Motivated: A Short History of Anti-Asian Racism in North America,"*From the* r/AskHistorians *mod team:*

On Tuesday, 16 March 2021, eight people were murdered in a series of attacks on massage parlors in and around Atlanta, Georgia (United States). Six of these victims were women of Asian descent. Their names are Daoyou Feng (冯道友), Hyun Jung Grant (김현정), Suncha Kim (김순자), Soon Chung Park (박순정), Xiaojie “Emily” Tan (谭小洁), and Yong Ae Yue (유용애). Two others, Delaina Ashley Yaun and Paul Andre Michels, were also murdered on Tuesday evening.

The brutality of these crimes has been met with expressions of shock and dismay across the globe; however, the Atlanta-area attacks are hardly unprecedented. Since the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic, over four thousand incidents of anti-Asian violence have been reported across Canada and the United States.^(\[1\]) While it is easy to ascribe the xenophobic hatred that fueled these attacks to the impact of Trumpian rhetoric, it is important to understand that the sentiments underpinning that rhetoric first originated in the white colonial empires of the nineteenth century. Anti-Asian racism is woven into the fabric of Canadian and American national history, and it is important to understand and acknowledge both the systematic othering of Asian Americans, Asian Canadians, and Asian immigrants to North America and the violence that such othering has historically inspired and, in many ways, excused.

**The “Yellow Peril”**

European states began colonizing parts of Asia in the sixteenth century in an attempt to control the production and movement of lucrative trade goods between Asia and Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and North and South America.  In this early period of colonialism, European perceptions of Asia were generally positive, resulting in a characterization of the region as being at least as civilized as Europe. However, by the nineteenth century, European intentions in Asia had become transparently imperialistic. Trade-driven colonization in the region was dominated by the United Kingdom, but Germany, France, Russia, and the United States, among others also held imperial aspirations in Asia. These aspirations were built increasingly upon stereotypes that characterized Asian persons as physically, intellectually, culturally, and morally inferior to the white Europeans who sought to exploit and control Asian resources. Gone were the positive stereotypes about Asia and its people, which were replaced by the same kinds of stereotypes that Europeans had used to justify the colonization of Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and the Americas, as well as the enslavement and murder of non-white peoples across the globe.

It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century, when Chinese immigrants began to arrive in North America, Australia, and New Zealand that this rhetoric of inferiority began to shift—not back to the previously positive stereotypes that had dominated European discourse during the Enlightenment, but toward an ideology that represented Asian people as a threat to white Europeans and North Americans. (See this [response](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k6efdb/what_was_happening_in_china_in_the_1850s_that/gesinbd/) by /u/EnclavedMicrostate from earlier this year for a more detailed discussion of the factors that influenced mid-nineteenth-century Chinese immigration, including the existing connections between the diminishing African slave trade and Chinese coolie immigration.) Chinese laborers were hard-working and willing to accept lower pay than their white counterparts; they were therefore soon perceived to be an economic threat to white Americans and Canadians. Previously benevolent but patronizing racial stereotypes were twisted and demonized to position Chinese people as a palpable danger to white supremacy and western culture. Political cartoons created by white artists in white-owned papers described Chinese immigrants as unclean, uncivilized, sexually voracious, listless, mindless, and as carriers of disease. They had become the “Yellow Peril”.

The discursive shift worked. The United States and Canada passed a series of exclusionary legislative acts that started with the Page Act of 1875, which prohibited the entry of Chinese women into the United States and ended with a series of miscegenation laws in the early twentieth century. In 1882, the United States passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which prohibited the immigration of all Chinese persons to the United States. The Scott Act (1888) prohibited Chinese laborers who went abroad from re-entering the United States. The Geary Act (1892), required Chinese residents of the United States to carry a resident permit at all times. Failure to do so was punishable by either deportation or by a year of hard labor. By this act, Chinese immigrants were unable to bear witness in a court of law and ineligible to receive bail in habeas corpus proceedings. In 1885, Canada passed its own Chinese Immigration Act, which imposed a head tax of $50 on all Chinese immigrants entering into Canada. This was intended to deter Chinese immigration to Canada, which was banned outright in 1923 with the passage of the Chinese Immigration Act / Chinese Exclusion Act. American legislation in 1917 (Immigration Act of 1917), 1922 (Cable Act), and 1924 (National Origins Quota) established a ban on immigration from most Asian countries, the exclusion of Asians as immigrants eligible for eventual naturalization and citizenship, and the loss of citizenship for any white American woman who married an Asian man. The National Origins Quota was explicitly enacted to “preserve the ideal of American homogeneity” by explicitly restricting immigration so that the relative proportion of races in the United States was maintained.

These racial stereotypes also functioned as a way to flatten all immigrants from the Asian continent, and their American born descendants, into a single group. This empowered and enabled white school leaders to make decisions about Asian and Asian American children and to deny them access to the better resourced schools attended by white children. In one high profile case in San Francisco in the early 1900s, a Japanese family was told they had to enroll their English-speaking child in a segregated school for Chinese students. The rationale for this decision was based in the same case law and policy, including *Plessy v. Ferguson,* that was used by white school leaders to bar Black and Hispanic students from white schools.  (More [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9wp5do/did_immigrants_to_the_united_states_in_the_18th/e9pjl7x/) on the history of schooling for immigrant children.)

While discrimination and exclusion were legalized by the federal governments of Canada and the United States, violence toward Asian immigrant communities was frequently enacted by white Americans and Canadians. On 24 October 1871, a mob of 500 white persons entered Los Angeles’s Old Chinatown and attacked, robbed, and murdered members of the Chinese community. Twenty Chinese immigrants were murdered by the mob, some shot and some lynched before their bodies were then hung on display. At least one of the victims was mutilated, having a finger cut off by a white attacker in order to obtain the man’s diamond ring. Riots in San Francisco broke out in July 1877 following growing tensions between Chinese and white laborers during a railroad workers’ strike. Four Chinese immigrants were murdered and over $100,000 worth of property damage was inflicted upon the city’s Chinatown.

The Yellow Peril pogrom of Denver in 1880 featured the lynching of a Chinese man and the destruction of the local Chinatown ghetto. In 1885, an entire community of Chinese immigrants was wiped out in Rock Springs, Wyoming at the hands of a white mob. That same year, a group of white laborers fired their guns into the tents of several sleeping Chinese hop pickers in Squak Valley, Washington. Three Chinese were killed and three more were wounded.

On 3 November 1885, the Chinese population of Tacoma, Washington was forcefully expelled from the city by city authorities and a mob of white supporters. The following year, 200 Chinese civilians were forcefully expelled from Seattle, Washington by the local Knights of Labor Chapter. In 1886, white laborers in Vancouver attacked an encampment of Chinese laborers, driving them out into the icy waters of the harbor in retaliation for the Chinese laborers having “stolen” the white laborers’ jobs. The attackers then stole the Chinese laborers’ tents and provisions and camped in the tents. In 1887, thirty-four Chinese gold miners were ambushed and murdered by a gang of seven white men, who robbed and mutilated the corpses.

This racially motivated violence continued into the twentieth century. In September 1907, a series of anti-Asian riots broke out across the Pacific Northwest. Though they were not coordinated, they reflected common underlying anti-Asian attitudes held by white Canadians and Americans. Sparked by labor tensions and the perception by white Americans and Canadians that Asian immigrants were stealing white jobs, the riots resulted in considerable damage to Asian-owned property, theft, injuries, and an unknown number of deaths.

While the anti-Asian violence in the western United States and Canada can and should be attributed, at least in part, to economic tensions between whites and Asians, it is also important to note the effect that the Boxer War had on North American attitudes toward Chinese immigrants. If these immigrants were already perceived with general hostility, the reports of the atrocities committed by Boxers during this uprising only strengthened the Yellow Peril ideology that dominated discourse about Asians in North America. Drawing upon reports of violence, rape, and murder committed by the Boxers (though excluding reports of European reprisals during colonial responses to the rebellion), Asians were characterized as subhuman, beastly, and more of a threat than ever before.

As part of this dehumanization of Asians, the Yellow Peril ideology also cemented particular sexual tropes about Asian individuals. Asian women were characterized as sexually voracious and exotic, capable of dominating and manipulating men with sexual skills that other women could not hope to possess. In this period, Asian men were characterized as amoral seducers, intent upon coercing white women into sex. Such characterizations date back to the 1850s, when Horace Greeley published an op-ed in the *New York Tribune* on the subject of Chinese immigration. He wrote:

>*But of the remainder, what can be said? They are for the most part an industrious people, forbearing and patient of injury, quiet and peaceable in their habits; say this and you have said all good that can be said of them. They are uncivilized, unclean, and filthy beyond all conception, without any of the higher domestic or social relations; lustful and sensual in their dispositions; every female is a prostitute of the basest order; the first words of English that they learn are terms of obscenity or profanity, and beyond this they care to learn no more.*

By the 1920s, eugenicists in the United States had co-opted Yellow Peril rhetoric to misrepresent the U.S. as a nation of white Anglo-Saxon protestants that was threatened by miscegenation with the Asian Other. Such discourse was exploited in the 1930s by William Randolph Hearst, who used the Yellow Peril ideology to attack Elaine Black, an American communist and political activist, due to her relationship with Karl Yoneda, a Japanese-American communist activist.

While much of white North America’s rancor for Asian immigrants had been directed toward Chinese immigrants in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first two decades of the twentieth, by the 1930s, the imperial aspirations of Japan and the events of the Chinese Civil War had begun to shift the focus of anti-Asian racism. Following Japan’s invasion of China in 1937, the American government reluctantly agreed to aid Chiang Kai-shek’s faction against the communist Mao Tse-tung. This relationship was formalized after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. No longer were the Chinese the cultural enemy of the United States—now, it was Imperial Japan that represented the greatest threat to white North America. Between 1942 and 1946, 142,000 Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians were incarcerated in internment camps. (For more on Japanese internment camps, see the answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/c4zn4v/was_there_an_argument_about_what_to_call_japanese/) by /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov, the answers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8tm76v/what_were_the_reactions_to_japanese_internment/) by /u/sakuraxatsume and /u/Lubyak, the answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5do4i7/is_there_evidence_that_japanese_internment_camps/) by /u/DBHT14, and the answers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/45x8mo/what_happened_to_those_that_resisted_the_japanese/) by /u/kizhe.)

Victory over Japan in the Second World War shifted perceptions of Asians in North America yet again. In the postwar period, Asian Americans and Asian Canadians worked hard to assimilate more fully into Canadian and American society. In 1952, Asian immigrants were finally granted the right to become naturalized citizens of the United States, and in 1965, the exclusionary immigration acts were finally fully repealed, allowing for free Asian immigration into the United States for the first time in over eighty years.

**The Myth of the Model Minority**

The success of Asian Americans in the postwar period prompted sociologist William Peterson to dub Asians the “model minority” in a 1966 *New York Times* editorial. This ideological transformation represents the other side of historic anti-Asian racism in North America. As an ideology, though, it is especially insidious.

It should not be taken as any surprise that Peterson published his editorial on the “model minority” at the height of the American civil rights movement. In his editorial, he describes both the “model minority” and the “problem minority”, which is implied to be Black Americans, though he never explicitly states this. Thus, the two racial groups were (and continue to be) unfairly compared to one another. Asian Americans were the model minority because they had successfully assimilated into North American society through hard work and the pursuit of education. Black Americans were the problem minority because they had failed to “improve” themselves in the same way given the same amount of time. What makes this characterization *especially* unfair, however, is that the Immigration Act that had been passed in 1965 explicitly gave preference to Asian immigrants who were educated, wealthy, or worked in certain professions. The “successes” to whom Black Americans were being compared had, to some degree, been recruited to prove a point. In all reality, the purpose of the model minority myth was to absolve white Americans and white Canadians of any responsibility for the structural inequalities from which they had benefited. After all, if Asians could do it, then every other race should be able to as well!

But, the model minority myth is also *incredibly* racist towards Asians. According to Peterson’s characterization, Asians are intelligent, hard-working, polite, submissive, self-sufficient, driven but rule-abiding, obsessed with the appearance of success, and terrified of disappointing the expectations of their families. The myth sanitized Asians. By being rule-abiding and submissive, they no longer posed a threat to white supremacy and culture. Instead, they became adorably harmless. No longer were Asian men a threat to white male sexuality through their predatory desire for white women. Instead, Asian men were effectively neutered. They were recast as weak, effeminate, and nerdy. Asian women, however, maintained their exotic “China doll” sexuality. No longer did this sexuality represent danger to white men; rather, Asian women became sexual objects to be “enjoyed” by white men. The stereotype of sexual voracity became sexual availability. The Dragon Lady became a Lotus Blossom, and what is especially pernicious about this recharacterization is that this racist stereotype removes sexual agency from Asian women. Research suggests that the three businesses targeted by the Atlanta murderer were legitimate massage therapy spas. They were not places where a client could expect to receive a “happy ending”.  Yet, many immediately assumed that these businesses as sexually-oriented. Despite claims that the attacks were not racially motivated, there’s a reason why he assumed Asian women working at spas were sex workers. This linkage between Asian women and sex work dates back to the first waves of Asian immigration to North America and has only been strengthened by the availability paradigm created by the model minority myth. This connection between Asian women and sex work makes Asian women especially vulnerable to this kind of racialized violence since sex workers have historically been one of the most vulnerable and targeted populations for gender-based violence across the globe.

Now, whether or not these businesses provided sexual services, the fact remains that Asian women have been so racially sexualized in North American culture that people automatically assume that Asian massage therapists are sex workers. What follows may be somewhat redundant, but we are repeating it to drive home a point.

Since the middle of the nineteenth century, Asian women have been stereotyped as sexually voracious and available. Over the course of the twentieth century, they have been characterized as objects to be enjoyed by (especially white) men. Asian women have been fetishized, objectified, and dehumanized, their individuality stripped from them by a social paradigm that suggests their role is not only to provide pleasure, but also to enjoy the act of doing so. 

Racism and misogyny cannot be separated when violence is committed against Asian women. The perception that they are (or should be) always sexually available makes it easy for white men to label or treat them as sex workers. This stereotype removes sexual agency from Asian women: their desires are sublimated to the sexual desires imposed upon them. And, this is perceived to be their own fault, because, in a spectacular leap of circular logic, they have been painted as sexually voracious and available. This being so, it is not difficult to see how easy it is for those who buy into these stereotypes to then perceive Asian women as sex workers or their equivalents. Leaving aside the deeply problematic rhetoric that goes into justifying violence committed against sex workers, let us return to the crimes committed on 16 March. 

The shooter claimed that he is a sex addict and that he targeted his victims because they tempted him and enabled his addiction. Yet, at least six of the victims were not even massage therapists. Four of these six victims were Asian women and the other two appear to have been patrons who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the four Asian women who were murdered never actually serviced patrons, then what temptation did they offer the shooter? Only the imaginary temptation provided by their existence as Asian women in a society that has labeled them as sex objects based solely on their race and the legacy of Yellow Peril and Model Minority ideology. It is possible that the shooter himself is not even self-aware enough to realize his actions were motivated, even in part, by racial stereotypes about Asian women. His ignorance, however, does not erase the fact that racism played a role in his decision to murder eight people.

While much more can be said about the Myth of the Model Minority and the way that it places unreasonable expectations upon Asian Americans and Asian Canadians to perform, perhaps the most important thing to state in conclusion is that the Myth of the Model Minority is, in many respects, a silencing ideology. Asians have been characterized as polite and submissive and many have internalized this characterization. In so doing, Asians in North America are less likely to fight back against racially motivated violence. And perhaps this is why the Atlanta area massacres were so shocking. The thousands of individualized attacks in the last year were perpetrated against people socialized to be polite, submissive, and self-sufficient. People, moreover, who have been socialized to just accept what gets thrown at them because they’re the “good” minority…but only so long as they know their place.

Taking photographs and displaying pictures or portraits was forbidden, as it was considered by the Taliban as a form of idolatry.

>Now, in many ways, the first book was the Bible. I mean, literally. Because, at one point, there was only one book. Like, as far as our Western culture is concerned, there was one book. And, for a while, literally, there was only one book, and that book was the Bible, and then, before it was the Bible, it was scrolls and writings on papyrus, but we were starting to aggregate written text together. And it went through all sorts of technological transformations, and then it became books that everybody could buy -- the book  everybody could buy -- and the first one of those was the Bible. And then became all sorts of books that everybody could buy, but all those books, in some sense, emerged out of that underlying book, and that book itself -- the Bible isn't a book; it's a library. It's a collection of books.

Is this true at all?

103,1585708389.0,AITA for imprisoning a man until he agreed to marry me?,"Recently, while entertaining friends, it was revealed that my courtship with my husband was less than orthodox. My friends now think that I'm an asshole for the way that I wooed him.

When I was sixteen, my first husband (Adam) was killed while on Crusade. This news was relayed to me by one of Adam's comrades-at-arms (Robert, 29M) who arrived in Carrick bearing Adam's heart for burial in the family chapel. Although I had been fond of Adam (he was the father of my eldest daughter, after all), and was grieved at the news of his death, I was immediately struck by Robert's appearance and manners. I was, in fact, infatuated: not only was Robert handsome and charming, but as a cousin of the king, he was well-positioned at court and within the realm.

I extended Robert an invitation to stay with me for several days so that he could rest after his journey from the Holy Land and he accepted my hospitality. As I really wanted him to stay with me forever, I instructed my household guard to ensure that Robert was confined to the boundaries of my estate. He was given freedom of the castle and its grounds, though, and I made every effort to be a charming, gracious, and attractive hostess.

After several weeks of chaste companionship, I worked up the courage to propose marriage; either Robert could marry me and become lord of my estate, or, he could remain as my guest indefinitely. He chose to marry me and our first daughter was born nine months after the wedding. In the last fifteen years, we have had eleven children and have enjoyed a largely happy union.

Still, our marriage did cause Robert's cousin, King Alexander III, some consternation. As countess of Carrick in my own right, I was considered an heiress of some importance within the kingdom, a ward of the crown's, and technically, I needed the king's approval to marry again. Yet, as I had married his own cousin, Alexander III could not really object to the match; that said, he fined us heavily before agreeing to allow my new husband the use of my title. By virtue of our marriage, Robert has therefore become the earl of Carrick in addition to the lord of Annandale. He is the administrator of my estate in Carrick, and of my fortune. I am happily the wife of a man that I chose and the mother of many beloved children.

During the day, however, I'm a historian of 1930s Europe - more particularly, of the ways in which people responded to the Spanish Civil War of 1936-9.

What has always fascinated me about this conflict - and hopefully interests you as well! - is that what might otherwise have been a minor civil war in a fairly unimportant European state became a crucial battlefield in a much wider confrontation between fascism and anti-fascism. Spain swiftly became a global phenomenon, inspiring and horrifying people all around the world. Many were moved to respond and take matters into their own hands - by becoming political activists, by collecting money, food and medicine, and by volunteering to join the fight themselves, in completely unprecedented numbers.

Exploring the motives, organisation and experiences of participants in these movements has been the subject of my research for just about a decade now, and I welcome any questions you might have! I'll also do my best to address any broader questions about the Spanish Civil War and the wider ideological conflict between fascists and anti-fascists during the 1930s.

For anyone interested in learning more about my particular research in more depth, I'm currently [running a competition on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FraserRaeburn/status/1329354199805665280) to give away a copy of my recently-published book that focuses on Scottish responses to the civil war!

162,1600952536.0,What was married sex life like before birth control?,"So I understand that throughout history various forms of birth control were attempted (ex: gumming up the cervix, different herbal preparations) although likely these methods were not effective. The most effective method was probably coitus interruptus and regular breastfeeding and as we know, compared to modern contraceptives, those have a low success rate at preventing pregnancy. Given the fact that every instance of penetrative sexual intercourse therefore had a medium-to-high chance of causing pregnancy, how did that change the dynamic of married life? As a woman myself, I can't imagine the prospective of getting pregnant YET AGAIN after being through the process multiple times previously as was the norm historically would be something I would personally look forward to. Given that, I wonder if the ever-present risk of pregnancy led to any one or multiple of the following:

1) Less sex overall within married couples compared to what is present in modern times (which apparently is about on average 1-2x per week)

2) More forms of non-penetrative sex being used for enjoyment -- although I've read that oral sex itself historically was not as prevalent/morally permissible as it is now

3) A situation where the husbands, who didn't bear the physical burden of pregnancy, would end up with a drastically mismatched sex drive compared to their wives, who seeking to avoid the discomforts of pregnancy, would seek to avoid sex, leading to less harmonious marriages on the whole or increased incidence of extra-marital relationships for men

During German occupation of Poland my grandad  (a jew) witnessed his family killed and was taken in and sheltered by a family in his village. One day out in town (aparrently he was stealing) he was ‘rounded up’ and made to work on a ‘farm’ as a pre-teen child (not sure of age). He escaped this situation somehow and walked from a village in Krakow to Naples where he was able to somehow get a boat to the Uk. He was sent to a town in the Midlands to work in a coal mine. 
 He didn’t know his age, he didn’t know how to spell his surname, he taught himself to speak and read english. He lost his ability to speak Polish and never, ever spoke about his experiences. I suppose my question is quite complicated. Does this sound plausible? This is all what was put together by my nan and father over the years. What was the farm? Was it a legitimate farm or something else? His walk to Naples. What countries would he have passed through to make it there most likely? I would like to travel this route myself. How did he know to go to Naples? If you google my (misspelled by my grandad) surname the record of his presence on a ship from Naples is recorded. He really spelled his name wrong and we ended up with a very unique spelling!! Why was he sent to a coal mine? How would he have got there? How long would his journey end to end have taken him?

Eisenhower wrote: ""I felt that the evidence should be immediately placed before the American and British publics"" Did any other allied generals make a systemic attempt at documenting the holocaust?","General Eisenhower wrote in his memoir *Crusade in Europe* the following passage regarding his reaction to the concentration camps and the action he felt he needed to take: 



> The same day I saw my first horror camp. It was near the town of Gotha. I have never felt able to describe my emotional reactions when I first came face to face with indisputable evidence of Nazi brutality and ruthless disregard of every shred of decency. Up to that time I had known about it only generally or through secondary sources. I am certain, however that I have never at any other time experienced an equal sense of shock.



> I visited every nook and cranny of the camp because I felt it my duty to be in a position from then on to testify at first hand about these things in case there ever grew up at home the belief or assumption that `the stories of Nazi brutality were just propaganda.’ Some members of the visiting party were unable to through the ordeal. I not only did so but as soon as I returned to Patton’s headquarters that evening I sent communications to both Washington and London, urging the two governments to send instantly to Germany a random group of newspaper editors and representative groups from the national legislatures. I felt that the evidence should be immediately placed before the American and British publics in a fashion that would leave no room for cynical doubt.



1. Was this information ever presented to the public in a widespread manner? What form did Eisenhower's ""evidence"" he wanted placed ""before the American and British publics"" specifically take? Did he take specific actions during his Presidency to enshrine the events of the Holocaust? Did General Eisenhower ever give congressional, tribunal or otherwise official legal testimony like he stated he wanted to in regards to what he witnessed?


2. Did Holocaust denial occur immediately after the war? How did allied commanders or leadership react to this phenomenon? 


3. Did other allied reprisals occur apart from Dachau in response to what soldiers witnessed at the concentration camps? 



4. Was the phrase ""I felt it my duty to be in a position from then on to testify first hand about these things in case there ever grew up at home the belief or assumption that `the stories of Nazi brutality were just propaganda’"" indicative of Eisenhower presaging Holocaust denial? Was Eisenhower specifically ever confronted with the reality of Holocaust denial? Why was he so worried about it initially?


5. Are there any specific documentation of impacts, military or civilian correspondence in terms of impact on Jewish soldiers following the liberation of the camps?

6. Finally, is the onset of Holocaust denial in the decades following the end of the war at all attributable to the lack of public awareness in regards to the Nazi genocide apparatus? Could a more systemic public presentation of available information have curtailed it? Or rather was Holocaust denial an inevitable movement that would spring from Nazi apologism and historical revision? This is tied to the original question.



I'm sorry if I included too many sub-questions... This is my first post on this sub and I didn't see any rules about sub-questions so I just went ahead and included them. I posted this because I've just finished Eisenhower's book and this part stuck out to me specifically because it seemed he, as the Supreme Allied Commander of the ETO was extremely cautious of Holocaust denial, even at the time and would have been in a unique position to push for official documentation. I read through the /r/askhistorians threads about Holocaust denial but couldn't really find anything specific about Eisenhower and the specific actions he took in regards to it. I'm further curious as to what institutional measures were taken to enshrine the historicity of the Holocaust and if allied and post-war leaders other than Ike considered this of paramount importance and what he specifically did to follow through with his stated intentions in *Crusade in Europe*.

This draft seemingly reflects that opinion and contains the line, “We hold that *Roe* and *Casey* must be overruled.” This decision will be the first instance in American history when a Supreme Court decision will pull back rights from half the population previously affirmed as Constitutionally protected. 

When the December arguments were announced in November 2021, we published a post on the history of abortion in America. We’re sharing it again to give people one place to ask their questions about the history of abortion in America and to acknowledge how profound and unjust this decision is. We’ve updated and clarified some of the history in the text and have provided additional resources and recommendations. Just like previous megathreads, we welcome top-level questions about the topic, which in this case is the legal and social history of abortion in America. While we do not have any flairs with this particular specialty, there are members of the community who can speak to different aspects of the history. Anyone is welcome to ask or answer questions, provided the comment meets our standards ([an explanation of our rules]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules)). Please note that comments that are nothing more than a user’s opinion on abortion or people who seek out or provide them, will be removed. Users who break our rules around civility will be banned.

It’s important to note that while it is accurate to say that overturning *Roe* simply returns abortion to the states - and the draft ruling makes that case - such a claim misrepresents the current landscape related to limitations on abortion and reproductive justice. 20 states have anti-abortion *trigger* bans (bans that take effect when *Roe v. Wade* is overturned) or *zombie* laws (anti-abortion laws that were never repealed following *Roe*, meaning when *Roe* is overturned, the state will revert to laws that were in place in 1973). Some of these laws would penalize the person performing the abortion, others would subject the person getting the abortion - regardless of the reason for the abortion or their health status - to criminal prosecution. (More on these laws [here](https://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2283&context=student_scholarship).) In anticipation of this ruling, in the same vein as networks in the 1960s, reproductive justice groups are working on educating people who can get pregnant about [safe means of self-inducing an abortion early in the pregnancy](https://nwhn.org/safe-online-delivered-how-to-get-the-abortion-pill-by-mail/) or fundraising in order to provide people who want or need an abortion later in the pregnancy with the funds needed to [travel out of state](https://states.guttmacher.org/). There are a lot of takes about the document on social media today and while it's impossible to cover the full complexity of abortion in a single post - we've skimmed over religion, it’s our hope this thread provides some clarity.

______

On June 8th, 1964, an employee at the Norwich Motel in Norwich, Connecticut opened the door to one of the rooms and discovered an unresponsive woman kneeling on the floor, her cheek pressed to the carpet, bloody sheets and towels between her legs. When the police and ambulance arrived, they declared the woman dead and began collecting evidence, including medical equipment and a textbook. Geraldine ""Gerri"" Santoro’s daughters would be told that she died in a car accident, not knowing until they were older their mother had recently left their father and was pregnant at the time of her death. Much later, her daughters and sister would learn Gerri had been worried how her husband would react if he found out she was pregnant and had rented the hotel room with her boyfriend, Clyde Dixon, intending to self-induce an abortion. According to his testimony during his trial for manslaughter, Dixon used the textbook to teach himself the procedure and panicked when Gerri began to hemorrhage. He fled. He would eventually serve a year in prison for manslaughter. The man who provided him with the textbook was charged with “conspiring to commit an abortion.” Almost ten years later, in April 1973, just months after the ruling in the affirmative for Roe, Ms. magazine published a photograph of Gerri taken by the police, showing her just as the maid found her. The article with the photograph was titled simply, ""Never Again."" 

When we look at the history of abortion in America, there are generally three groups of people who are part of the historical record: people who can and did get pregnant, medical care providers (midwives, healers, doctors, etc.), and lawmakers (judges, police, legislatures, etc. - almost exclusively cis white men until the modern era.)  Before getting into how these groups interacted, it’s helpful to start with language. First, as panel members during the AH conference session [The Lie Became the Truth: Locating Trans Narratives in Queer History](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qbdy27/the_lie_became_the_truth_locating_trans/) demonstrated, trans and non-binary people have always existed. The history of abortion in America includes them; they are a part of the history. Not only have trans, non-binary, and Two-Spirit people needed and sought out abortions, using only the word women to describe those who got abortions ignores or disregards the girls who have gotten pregnant and needed or wanted an abortion. As such, it’s not only more inclusive but also more precise and historically accurate to talk about people who can get or have been pregnant. For more on this topic, see this 2018 article from Barbara Sutton and Elizabeth Borland, [Queering abortion rights: notes from Argentina](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691058.2018.1437221)

Next is the word *abortion* itself. Historian Sara Dubow, author of [Ourselves Unborn: A History of the Fetus in Modern America](https://amzn.to/2XZPSiO) begins her book by explaining to the reader that a “fetus in 1870 is not the same thing as a fetus in 1970, which is not the same thing as a fetus in 2010. Although multiple and competing fetuses have always coexisted, particular historical circumstances have generated and valorized different stories about the fetus.” (p. 3) Similarly, and to be sure the boundaries are not clean and discrete, it’s important to recognize there are multiple histories of abortion in America; that the social and legal history related to enslaved people’s bodily autonomy, access to contraception and abortion, and infanticide is different than the histories of abortion in Indigenous communities. In addition, the cultural and social norms around abortion varied between and among Indigenous communities and before and after colonization. These different definitions shape the meaning of the word and how the concept itself is viewed by a community or a particular group of people. In most histories of abortion in America, the focus is on white women. Yet, even for them, the meaning of the word, and the act itself, varied based on class, geographical location, and time period. (Historian Rickie Solinger describes these different yet interrelated histories and experiences as “reproductive politics.” Her book, *Pregnancy and Power* speaks to the question, “Who has power over matters of pregnancy and its consequences?”) So, while a reader in 2022 may think of a particular thing upon hearing the word, it’s important to stress that what we call an abortion hasn’t always been considered an abortion.

**Abortion in Early America**

One of the claims in the draft decision is that there is no Constitutional right to abortion because access to abortion is not part of American history. The draft goes as far as to say, “The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation's history and traditions.” (p. 24.) While it is beyond the scope of this post to argue that the right to an abortion is part of America history, there is overwhelming evidence in the historical record that abortion was a part of people’s lives, going back to before America was America and people got abortions will few or no legal consequences. It’s likely that the dissenting opinions will speak to that history. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that the draft opinion had to pull on English law to make a claim regarding the nature of abortion (“Sir Matthew Hale likewise described abortion of a quick child who died in the womb as a ‘great crime’ and a ‘great misprision.’ See M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown: Or, A Methodical Summary of the Principal Matters Relating to that Subject 53 (1673)” p. 17.) The name Michael Hale is well known among women’s historians as he laid the foundation for what’s known as the “marital rape exception”; a provision that claimed a husband could legally rape his wife as she’d given up her right to refuse sex upon marriage. (More on Hale and his rulings [here](https://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1248&context=ggulrev). 

It’s helpful for the purpose of understanding the history to focus not on the law itself, but on the experiences of those who could get pregnant. Let us take, for example, the scenario of an American woman in 1780 who realizes that more weeks have passed since the last time her uterus shed its lining (or as we might think of it today, since her last period) than usual. ([Revolutionary Conceptions: Women, Fertility and Family Limitations in America, 1760-1820](https://amzn.to/3EsQ35O) by Susan E. Klepp provides an in-depth look at what that woman may have been feeling and thinking upon that realization.) The most pressing problem at hand is her health, not if she’s pregnant. More specifically, she would be concerned that her body was out of balance. The prevailing thinking at the time – from laypeople, midwives, and leading medical professionals – was that a late or delayed period could indicate an illness that needed to be treated. At this point, she had two options: wait or treat the illness. For the sake of clarifying the meaning of the term abortion as it was used during that era, let’s say this woman sought out a local midwife or healer to fix the problem of “blocked menses.” She may have also consulted one of the many available medical or household guides which would recommend a variety of ways to bring on one’s period, including warnings about quantity and side effects. What she would want is known as an *emmenagogues*, an herb that stimulates bleeding or contractions in the uterus, which would, in effect, restart her period. While there were a number of wild and cultivated herbs with varying side effects for the person taking them, one of the most common means of inducing an abortion was savin, created from drying and powdering the leaves or extracting oil from a juniper plant. (According to James C. Mohr, author of *Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy*, accidental overdoses of savin were common throughout American history. His findings remind us that abortion has always been a part of health care.)

If the woman ingested the savin and her period started, all was well – her health had been restored, her menses unblocked. Even though she’d taken something classified today as an abortifacient, she had not gotten an abortion – even if she had been pregnant. In other words, doing something to bring on one’s period was not considered an abortion in the way Hale or the draft document describe it. (There were some religious exemptions to this but that’s outside the scope of this post. Cornelia Hughes Dayton’s 1991 article, [Taking the Trade: Abortion and Gender Relations in an Eighteenth-Century New England Village](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2937996) is a very detailed look at the death of one particular woman following a botched surgical abortion and explores the religious implications in more depth. “Taking the trade” was the most common phrase for taking something to unblock one’s menses.) However, let’s say instead she waited until the next month. If her period restarted with no intervention, she had evidence her body was back in balance.

Let’s say she waits one more month and nothing happens. Her body is still out of balance and she may still elect to seek out ways to unblock her menses. However, if she waited a bit longer, somewhere around four or five months after the first missed period, she might receive her confirmation that she wasn’t ill, but pregnant (it’s estimated that 20% of pregnancies end due to spontaneous abortion, or miscarriage - [*The Myth of the Perfect Pregnancy: A History of Miscarriage in America*](https://amzn.to/2ZCcaHI) by Lara Freidenfelds is a fantastic read on the topic). This confirmation was known as *quickening*, when the pregnant person reported feeling fetal movement. She may have had other indicators of pregnancy – nausea, fatigue, swollen breasts, etc. but it was generally recognized that the quickening was the moment at which the pregnancy was officially confirmed. If at this point, she sought out the same midwife and asked for something to bring on her flow, she would then be, as defined at the time, seeking out an abortion. However, getting an abortion or terminating a pregnancy after the quickening was not necessarily illegal and for most white people who could get pregnant, was seen as a form of birth control with social implications more in line with other forms reducing the number of children a person has and less like it was framed by the pro-life movement in 20th century, as the “murder of an unborn child.” 

In many ways, the sentiment around abortion in white communities for most of American history was very different than it is today. Obtaining or providing an abortion happened in public; ads for abortion providers were common in newspapers in the 1800s and early 1900s. Perhaps the most significant difference was the disconnect from partisanship. That is, positions on abortion laws were not a proxy for political parties and prevailing sentiments around miscarriage and abortion were more complex and more nuanced than they are today. As a reminder, despite the use of “we the people” in the Constitution, nearly all people who were not white men were excluded from the spaces that determined the laws and policies around American life until well into the 20th century. Which is to say, as we move into a discussion of laws banning abortion, it’s important to remember that the discussions and lawmaking structures were designed, driven, dominated, and shaped by men and their understanding of pregnancy. This is not to say white women were not instrumental in anti-abortion advocacy and the work of historians such as Elizabeth Gillespie McRae in [Mothers of Massive Resistance: White Women and the Politics of White Supremacy](https://amzn.to/3brvuu8), Daniel K. Williams in [Defenders of the Unborn: The Pro-Life Movement before Roe v. Wade](https://amzn.to/3pWi9SX), and [The Lie that Binds](https://amzn.to/3wdzwQx) by Ellie Langford and Ilyse Hogue explore their role in more depth. 

One of the reasons it’s important we distinguish between the history of abortion among white women and women of color is that for most enslaved people who could get pregnant, their status as a parent or a potential parent often came down to how their enslaver thought of the children they might bear. [Killing the Black Body](https://amzn.to/3bnlAtz) by Dorothy Roberts offers a detailed look at enslaved women and their reproductive decisions, including the different ways courts handled infanticide and the essay [Native American Health: Historical and Legal Context](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425854/) provides more context on the factors that impacted Indigenous people. For more on white women’s sense of identity related to motherhood, Barbara Welter’s [The Cult of True Womanhood: 1820-1860](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2711179) makes for an interesting read. Finally, Nicola Beisel and Tamara Kay’s article [Abortion, Race, and Gender in Nineteenth-Century America](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/000312240406900402) provides even more context on the topic.

**1820s - 1960s** 

While there were communities where abortion was treated as a punishable event, it’s generally recognized that the first meaningful laws related to abortion emerged in the mid-1800s as abortifacients became increasingly commercialized. In effect, the early laws were about poison control. Just as general medicine was moving into a snake oil phase, so did medicines related to menstruation, abortion, and childbirth. One common sentiment at the time was the worse a person’s reaction to a medicine, the better the cure was working. Manufacturers added ingredients that increased the side effects experienced by the person taking the treatment, often eliminating the abortifacients themselves and basically poisoning the person taking the “trade.” These early laws were primarily focused on protecting those who sought out an abortion; they did not seek to punish the pregnant person. In addition, they did not outlaw or ban particular plants or herbs themselves. Midwives and healers could still grow, harvest, and administer plants that could induce an abortion. As these plants could also help ease delivery or resolve an incomplete miscarriage, they were an essential part of maternal health. It’s also worth stating explicitly that these early laws did not seek to overrule a pregnant person’s autonomy or limit other means of completing or resolving an abortion, only those that were known to poison the pregnant person if taken in incorrectly or in the wrong dosage. This would no longer be the case by the end of the 19th century.

By 1867, every state had a law making some aspect of obtaining or providing an abortion illegal. However, as previously mentioned, these public acts did not eliminate them from people’s private lives. Historians estimate that between 1867 and 1973, the period of time abortion was a crime, upwards of 25% of pregnancies ended through abortion. Or as legal historian Karissa Haugeberg puts it, “it was a commonly practiced procedure, even though practiced criminally.” Yet, not all of the laws fully banned abortion. Lawmakers in Oregon held that an “unnecessary” abortion only became a crime when it, “results in the death of the mother, or of a quick foetus [a fetus after the point at which the pregnant person reports movement.].” Alabama had a similar law and Nebraska’s law was focused on cracking down on entrepreneurs selling abortion cures that were actually poison. Meanwhile, the degree to which states acted on these laws, even lawmakers within the same state, varied wildly, especially during the Great Depression when many parents were struggling to care for the children they already had. 

However, the public sentiment shifted in the 1950s as America experienced a baby boom and lawmakers began to crack down on abortion providers. Before World War II, a pregnant person with social connections could typically obtain a legal, safe abortion provided their doctor agreed it was medically necessary. As reproductive health services became less personalized, more clinical, it became harder for pregnant people to find a medical professional who was willing to certify their abortion was necessary. A pregnant person could plead their case in front of a panel at a hospital but it would require going public with the pregnancy. As safe and legal abortions became harder and harder to obtain, many communities created whisper networks and collectives, such as the Jane Collective in Chicago, that could connect pregnant people with a safe abortion provider. It also meant an increase in abortion providers who were more interested in any perceived financial benefits than reproductive health. It’s worth noting that many of these networks were led or otherwise supported by members of the clergy who were most likely to see the consequences of unsafe abortions on a community or family. During this period, those most likely to die from botched abortions were women and girls of color. In some cities, hospitals had to establish sepsis wards to treat those who contracted life-threatening infections following an unsafe abortion.

In terms of the thinking behind outlawing abortion despite its presence in society and its role in healthcare, historians offer a variety of reasons. First, the American Medical Association expressed a strong desire to move maternal and all healthcare related to pregnancy away from midwives, who were typically women trained through social networks and traditional apprenticeships, under a medical model they could control. Banning all abortions except those deemed “medically necessary” meant doctors, not midwives or the pregnant person, could control who got or performed - and who got paid for - an abortion. Second, according to historians including Beisel and Kay, white Americans in positions of power were worried about birth rates. In effect, they saw laws against abortion as a way to ensure the right (native-born, non-immigrant) kind of white babies were born and concurrent laws that allowed for the forced sterilization of Black and Indigenous women, white women deemed unworthy of raising children, as a way to ensure fewer undesirable babies were born. Third, it was about controlling women at a time when there was a sense they were “out” of control as seen in efforts to obtain the vote for women and coeducational higher education. When male legislatures passed laws outlawing abortion, it provided a way for them to control what was seen as the most fundamental purpose of womanhood: bearing children. From Kathryn Kolbert and Julie Kay, “at its core, the abortion debate is an embodiment of the conflict between traditional and more modern concepts of gender roles. In its darkest corners, the abortion debate is about controlling when and with whom sex is appropriate, and when and with whom one has babies. A woman is unfairly branded by the sexual and procreative decisions she makes: married or spinster, saint or sinner, madonna or whore, selfless mother or welfare queen.” (p. 9) In the 1950s and 60s, historians estimate that 200 people a year died from unsafe, usually self-induced, abortions.

States did create carve outs, known as *therapeutic abortions*, meaning the abortion was necessary for the woman's health. However, as this was a matter of opinion, abortion providers could use their discretion as they saw fit. And rape and incest were seen by many as a justifiable argument for using that discretion. The foundation for this thinking in America was generally based on a 1938 British court decision, *Rex v. Bourne*, which held that a pregnant person's mental well-being mattered. (The case involved a 14-year-old who was sexually assaulted, got pregnant, and was given the abortion she asked for. The doctor was charged with providing an illegal abortion and the judge ruled that the doctor had actually saved the girl's life by giving her the abortion and not forcing her to stay pregnant and give birth.)

Safe, legal abortion providers were more than willing to provide (and be paid for) an abortion for a married woman who'd been assaulted by a stranger but not necessarily to an unmarried woman who had multiple sexual partners and reported domestic violence. In ""When Abortion was a Crime,"" Regan writes about a series of Chicago hospital hypothetical case studies in the 1970s and what can best be described as ""wild inconsistency"" regarding if a person could get an abortion. In one hypothetical, the presenting patient was a minister's daughter who had been raped by a member of her father's church. Six out of six hospitals said they would provide an abortion. The studies found that the best way for a pregnant person to be approved for an abortion was to claim she was raped, attempt suicide or grievous self-harm, and claim financial hardship. When these factors were present, pregnant people were almost always given the safe, legal abortion they sought. However, beyond hypothetical cases, an individual intake worker's or hospital social worker's personal beliefs around abortion would determine the person's odds of getting an abortion. For example, if the social worker thought a baby could help a married woman's marriage, she wouldn't let the woman go any further. Some social workers were firmly anti-abortion and whisper networks knew not to recommend people to that hospital and other hospital social workers, who were often clergy, helped every pregnant person who showed up. This ""rape or incest"" loophole, as it were, and the willingness of medical providers to provide safe and legal abortions for those who sought one under that umbrella meant that there were cases where a pregnant person said they had been raped, even though they hadn't. When originally seeking an abortion, Norma McCorvey had considered reporting she'd been assaulted as friends had told her that was how they safely acquired an abortion. She changed her mind and did not pursue that option.

While the death toll from botched abortions did go down as antibiotics became more readily available, efforts to decriminalize abortion began in the mid-1960 in states such as Colorado and New York State. Most notably, the AMA which had previously pushed to outlaw abortion changed its position and began to advocate for legal, safe abortion as a part of maternal health care. In the late-60s, a team of lawyers, including Sarah Weddington, connected with a Texas woman named Norma McCorvey who wanted an abortion. Weddington would go on to argue on behalf of her client McCorvey, then known by the pseudonym, Jane Roe, that there was a constitutional right to an abortion. Weddington was only 29 years old at the time, making her the youngest person to ever argue a case in front of the Supreme Court.

**Roe v. Wade (1973)**

The legal decision in *Roe v. Wade* took place against a backdrop of contentious debate, and a shift in public opinion favoring abortion. While the Court agreed to hear Roe in 1970, it was almost two years before the Court heard arguments in the case, and it took 27 months from the filing of the case to the decision being issued. Justice Blackmun, the author of the opinion, was heavily influenced by his attempts to conduct medical research during this period, as well as discussions with his law clerks and other justices. Blackmun was also clearly aware of the shift in public opinion and medical advocacy, as his Roe files contained a Washington Post article that reported on one such poll. The poll, conducted in June 1972, found that 66% of Americans believed abortion should be “a matter for decision solely between a woman and her physician."" He collected articles representing a variety of viewpoints, including from the *American Journal of Public Health* depicting abortion as inevitable as well as dissenting articles from practicing obstetricians and gynecologists. Nevertheless, the sharpening of public opinion and medical opinion on the issue seems to have added to Justice Blackmun’s thinking, and no doubt weighed on the Court. Abortions done without the care of an attending physician and without the cover of state law killed hundreds, and in some years, thousands of people. While such deaths became less common with time due to improved care, they still formed a large percentage of childbirth-related deaths, and hospitalizations remained high. The Court was navigating a shift in public opinion and a continuing public health question, which influenced Justice Blackmun’s ultimate analysis. In fact, Justice Blackmun explicitly referenced these shifts in medical, public, historical, and legal understanding when announcing the decision in Roe from the bench. The other Justices were no less interested in the backdrop for the case, and some credit Justice Brennan with significant influence over the final opinion. There are suggestions in Blackmun’s papers and other records that Brennan and Justice Marshall were influential in pushing the trimester framework to its final result, whereby state regulation before viability but after the first trimester would be restrained to only specific areas, rather than leaving states completely free to regulate abortion after the first trimester. They, along with Justice Powell, wrote to Justice Blackmun about the proper points at which regulation could begin, and thus ended up creating the trimester framework. All were to some extent aware of, and conscious of, public opinion and medical opinion on abortion procedures at various points during pregnancy. (The recent Broadway show, *What the Constitution Means to Me* from Heidi Schreck provides more background on the judges, as well as audio of them debating the question. *Becoming Justice Blackmun* by Linda Greenhouse is a compelled read on his life and decision-making process.) 

That analysis focused on whether a right to privacy, grounded in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, could be the basis for the right to an abortion. The right to privacy was not a new idea. It had been a key part of the decision in *Griswold v. Connecticut* 7 years earlier, ruling ultimately that barring the use of contraceptives was unconstitutional. However, finding the right in the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of liberty was new, and legal commentators of all opinions have expressed both support and disappointment in Justice Blackmun’s analysis. The opinion reasoned that the right to privacy could only be overcome by a “compelling” government interest if the state wished to regulate under the authority of its interest in health. Roe thus created the “trimester” framework that many are familiar with, albeit one that would shift subtly over time: during the first trimester, a pregnant person’s privacy right outweighed the state’s interest in regulating health but during the second trimester and onwards, the state’s interest could outweigh the pregnant person’s if legitimately tied to its regulation of health. Roe also made clear that beyond viability, which the Court believed was at 26 or 27 weeks (approximately when quickening occurred), a state could outlaw abortion because the interest in the “potentiality” of life outweighed the pregnant person's right to privacy.

What Roe did not do, however, was affirm that the state had to facilitate or ensure pregnant people had access to abortion. By not affirming the right to abortion beyond the right to privacy or the state’s interest, by not affirming what we think of as bodily autonomy of pregnant people in the modern era, the ruling left space for a new approach to laws. The Hyde Amendment, which banned the use of federal dollars in funding or providing abortion services, took advantage of that lack of affirmation. In 1992, the Rehnquist court created via *Casey v. Planned Parenthood* a new litmus test for anti-abortion laws known as an ""undue burden"" defined as a ""substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability."" This allowed states to mandate wait times before an abortion, parental notification, and in some cases, required doctors to share misinformation with people seeking an abortion about the consequences of getting the service. States began to push the limits of anti-abortion laws until 2016 when *Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt* ended most of the so-called TRAP (targeted restrictions on abortion providers) laws such as requiring abortion-service providers be located in buildings that meet building requirements for ambulatory surgical centers or that doctors who work at the clinics have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Although *Hellerstedt* ruling was seen as an affirmation of *Roe v. Wade*, conservative lawmakers went back to the drawing board to find new ways to make abortion harder to get. 

**Implications**

Abortion is still legal(ish) ~~in all 50 states~~. People who have appointments for abortions today or in the near future should ~~keep them~~ (Edit June 24, 2022: check with your provider, unless you're in one of the states without a trigger or zombie law.) ~~It is still~~ Check the laws in your state to confirm it is still legal to receive and send the pills needed for a medical abortion. ~~While it’s impossible to know what will happen when the final ruling is released, the early responses to the draft from historians and legal scholars have expressed concern regarding the central argument in the draft which is basically, there is no Constitutional right to abortion because abortion isn’t mentioned in the Constitution.~~ (Scholars refer to those rights, those explicitly mentioned, as *enumerated rights.* ~~Abortion is, as of today, an unenumerated right.~~) Other unenumerated rights include the right to marry someone of the same gender (*Obergefell v. Hodges*), the right to access birth control *(Griswold v. Connecticut*), the right to join a union (*Lochner v. New York*) among others we take for granted in 2022.

Earlier today, June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned not only *Casey* but *Roe v. Wade* itself. As described above, this means that abortion is now illegal in states where it not is protected by state law or statue. Legal scholars and historians are still working through the brief itself but it's worth highlighting a phrase from Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan:

##**With sorrow—for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection—we dissent.**

I hope I'm not being presumptuous in assuming that this is relatively recent, at least, I understand that Bowler hats were only invented and popularized in the late 19th century in Britain, so its probably not something that has centuries of history. Wikipedia mentions that Bowler hats were introduced into Bolivia and Peru by British railway workers in the 1920s, but it doesn't answer to me why it became popular with indigenous people specifically (as opposed to the rest of the population of Bolivia and Peru), why it specifically became a fashion piece for women, despite not being so elsewhere, and why it has continued and ingrained itself into traditional dress in the century since.

201,1617022993.0,"Why do we translate Native American names into English, but seemingly no other culture's names?","*edit* This question remains unanswered.


For example, we don't refer to Tatanka Iyotake by his name, but by a rough translation of it 'Sitting Bull'.



We don't call Leonards 'Lionheart', no one translates Samuel into 'God is listening', and we don't listen to music by Sacred Rock (Craig David).


Similarly, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese names, we don't translate, but leave in their native language.



Any time there is a translation, it feels like a very deliberate, often politically charged move, the only example coming to my mind at this point is Battenberg to Mountbatten, with the obvious connotations of English royalty desiring a fully English name (Though Batten is still left untranslated. I'm unsure but I think it means 'Helpful', they didn't go all the way and become the Mounthelpful family).



So, why Sitting Bull instead of Tatanka Iyotake? Why Crazy Horse instead of Tasunke Witko? Why Little Turtle instead of Mihsihkinaahkwa? When a Japanese name, I would leave as, Eg, Okada Kazuchika, and not translate as Peaceful Reality of the Rice Paddy Ridge. You can't say the American names simply look strange and alien because that's true of any name of any naming convention that you aren't a part of. Bojana is a girl's name most people aren't familiar with, but you wouldn't translate it, and besides, you wouldn't translate Rebecca, though I am just as ignorant of the meaning of Rebecca as I am of Bojana. I wouldn't translate either, the idea of doing so would be very strange, but we all do this with Native American names. Why?


I would assume the answer may be as simple as a lack of family names, but mononymity isn't unique to American cultures I don't think? Besides I've never seen anyone refer to the famous Greek philosopher Best Purpose, who was a student of Broad Shoulders (Aristotle and Plato).

204,1594051578.0,"Confederate general and later founder of the Ku Klux Klan, Nathan Bedford Forrest, later apparently had a change of heart and near the end of his life advocated for racial harmony. Do historians see this as a genuine turn of face, or him trying to ingratiate himself to the new power structure?","He apparently grew at first, disillusioned by the poor organization of various white supremacist groups in the US, eventually denying he was a part of the KKK at all.

> After the lynch mob murder of four blacks who had been arrested for defending themselves in a brawl at a barbecue, Forrest wrote to Tennessee Governor John C. Brown in August 1874 and ""volunteered to help 'exterminate' those men responsible for the continued violence against the blacks"", offering ""to exterminate the white marauders who disgrace their race by this cowardly murder of Negroes"".

> On July 5, 1875, Forrest gave a speech before the Independent Order of Pole-Bearers Association, a post-war organization of black Southerners advocating to improve the economic condition of blacks and to gain equal rights for all citizens. At this, his last public appearance, he made what The New York Times described as a ""friendly speech"" during which, when offered a bouquet of flowers by a young black woman, he accepted them, thanked her and kissed her on the cheek. Forrest spoke in encouragement of black advancement and of endeavoring to be a proponent for espousing peace and harmony between black and white Americans.

This feels like a great risk to take in the 1870's, in the South no less, especially considering his former friends and the violence they were capable. 

Was Forrest sincere about this or was he simply trying to save his own skin by disconnecting himself from the KKK? It seems a bit silly to deny being a part of the KKK when you were one of it's founders and the first Grand Wizard.

I want to believe he really did have a genuine change of heart, but the hearts of Confederate generals changed hardly. Even Longstreets heel turn wasn't out of a sense of guilt or newfound racial tolerance, he was simply hoping to step into a position of governmental power that he could then use.

I guess I was taken aback a little when I heard, so it got me pondering this, wondering if this was literal, just a turn of phrase. Wondering what that meant to someone who would say that.

Most of them came from archives of old newspapers, so it seems like it was a real phrase used with some frequency at least in the late 1800's. I even saw it used in relation to a real man, which I think is a little significant.

So does the phrase originate from a real idea white people had about the afterlife back then? Or is it just a phrase people threw around without thinking about it? (Perhaps a mixture of both?)

I have to assume that this workaround was for the purpose of avoiding the 15th amendment, which seems to forbid explicit disenfranchisement by race.

The proposal we produced was a (very) solid one, but AskHistorians is such a new beast in the historical scene we thought it would likely be rejected (hence no announcement). “But wouldn’t it be cool to try?”

The proposal was accepted in every regard. 

The good news? Hey, we're famous! The great news? It's thanks to each and every one of you. We're the largest and most heavily trafficked history forum in the world, bar none. Now we’re going to strut our stuff at one of the largest and most heavily trafficked traditional history spaces.

The event will be from January 7-10 in Atlanta, GA. We are currently looking into having our presentations recorded (in a way we can distribute on multiple platforms) so that everyone will be able to watch the panel and see how it goes. We will also be posting the presentation abstracts in their own post shortly. 

Since acceptance, we've been running around behind the scenes on top of our normal moderating to get everything together. There is about 4 months until the event, and our last hurdle is funding. We've been working with the Reddit admins, who we cannot thank enough; they have been supportive and positive throughout. **Reddit, Inc. has generously agreed to cover half of our projected expenses, and have given us the go-ahead to crowdfund the remainder.** Which is where you come in! 

**This presentation is entirely about AskHistorians as a community and how it is reshaping public history. No one is presenting on their own personal historical work.** This is not really about us, it will be about you. We’re excited about heading to the world’s largest historical conference, but we’re going to Atlanta to represent you and we take that seriously. None of us are presenting within our “field” - it is entirely about AskHistorians. We really think something special is happening here, something that hasn’t been replicated anywhere else in academic history or in traditional public history venues like museums or documentaries. We’ve all together flipped the traditional method of transmitting history on its head. Normally an exhibit or a book or blog post is just thrown out and people hope to find an interested audience. Here, the audience itself starts the historical conversation and the experts respond to that. We’d like to tell other historians, other humanities fields, and more people who could be part of our community, about what we’re doing. 

**We are not the “ivory tower academics” that usually present at conferences.** Two of our panelists are currently affiliated with universities and are applying for grants with their schools. Our other three are the most disadvantaged animal in academia - “independent scholars.” They have no access to university funding that usually sends people to conferences, and are ineligible for most external travel grants. It is projected that it will take about $7,600 total to send our 5 people to this conference. We come before you to apply for The People’s Grant.

218,1529500413.0,"Monday Methods: ""The children will go bathing"" – on the study of cruelty","Welcome to a belated Monday Methods – our bi-weekly feature where we discuss, explain, and explore historical methods, historiography, and theoretical frameworks concerning history.

“*The children will go bathing*” is what the Nazi officer said to Dounia W. after she arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau with her two kids in 1943. Her children did not go bathing. Instead, they were forced together with other children and old people into the gas chamber, where they died a gruesome death. Dounia, on the other hand, was brought into the camp as a forced laborer. Because she spoke Polish, Russian, and German, she was able to survive as a translator and tell the story, of how she was separated from her children and how she realized she would never see them again, at the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial after the war.

Sessions of this and similar trials are full examples like this, which is one of many such stories historians of Nazi Germany and other eras in history encounter regularly in their work. The cruelty of both individuals and regimes that forcibly separate children from their parents, detain and imprison people they regard as ""alien"" or ""unworthy"" under horrible circumstances, force people into slavery, and commit atrocities and genocide.

“*Is such a thing possible today?*” and “*How was it possible back then?”* are frequent questions, and the answer for the historian both regarding the cruelty of individuals and the cruelty of state policy often lies in larger social and political processes, rather than solely individuals, psychopathology or something similar. The descend into cruelty and abhorrent deeds is one that in almost all historical situations is not caused by one individual's personal cruelty but by a socially and political accepted mindset of necessity and acceptance of cruelty.

A central tenet of historians dealing with cruelty is that there is always a larger social, ideological, and political dimension to it.

Nazi Germany will be the example I use but the same methods and ideas can be applied to other eras and examples in history and since the early ‘90s, historiography has shifted focus strongly to the perpetrators and their motives for killing and cruelty. Christopher Browning is one such prominent example, but another researcher who has had a large impact in studying this topic is the social-psychologist Harald Welzer.

“*Abolish certain established rationalities and establish new ones*” is how Welzer describes one of the most central processes pursued by the Nazi regime. Exploring the issue in his book “*Täter. Wie aus ganz normalen Menschen Massenmörder werden*” (Perpetrators. How normal people become Massmurderers), he starts off with the psychological evaluations of the main perpetrators indicted in Nuremberg. These tests by the official court psychologists as well as further studies undertaken by George Kren and Leon Rappoport (who evaluated SS-members) could not find a higher percentage of psychopaths and sociopaths among the perpetrators of the Holocaust than are usually assumed to be in any general population. These men weren't psychologically abnormal. Their process of justification was rather quite ""rational"" in a sense.

“*Ice cold killers brought to explain their deeds, assumed that their actions were plausible – as plausible in fact as they had been in 1941 and onward when they killed thousands of people*”, describes Welzer. They were able to integrate mass killing and other horrible deeds into their perception of normality. They had been able to make these actions part of their normative orientation, their values, and what they identified as acceptable in interpersonal interactions.

In his explanations for why this was possible, Welzer uses Erving Goffman's concept of frame analysis as way to explain individual actions. Goffman's idea holds that an individual tries to principally act in a way that's right, meaning that they want to emerge from a situation according to their perceptions and interpretations if possible without damage and with a certain profit. What influences their perception of what constitutes ""right"", ""no damage"" and so forth is however something that depends on the framing of the actions and the situations. These frames are the connecting nodes between larger ideas and concrete actions; they contain ideas about how the world works, how humans are, and what one can do and must not do. In that they are similar to Bourdieu's Habitus term and they are deeply influenced by our surroundings. Examples for such frames could be the kind of upbringing a person has enjoyed, f.ex. if they grew up in a religious household. Other such frames can stem from the education an individual enjoyed, but crucially, frames of reference for our behavior are formed and provided by the society and the institutions around us.
Welzer uses the example of a surgeon to exemplify this: A surgeon is a person who, speaking on some level, horribly injures another person. They literally cut another person open with a very sharp knife. That an individual surgeon is able to do what they do and often use it as a point of pride is because they can rationalize and legitimize their actions with their outcome – lives being saved – and through their social framing. Cutting another person open with a sharp knife is what the surgeon is employed for – how the institution they work in frames their actions. This is why the surgeon can act with what Wlezer calls ""professional detachment"", meaning that they are on a psychological level able to detach themselves from the full reality of cutting another person open with a sharp knife and instead frame it as a step necessary to save a life.

Despite the vast gulf between a surgeon and a Nazi perpetrator, the underlying processes and the effects of framing work similarly: Countless recorded conversations between German soldiers in Allied POW camps reveal that these soldiers thought about their cruel deeds in similar ways: Tearing families apart, rape, killing hundreds of people, shipping people into camps and putting them in barracks and cages – they regarded these actions as legitimate. The frames they referenced were the necessity for security threatened by Jews and Partisans, their orders, flimsy legal justifications, standing with their comrades-in-arms.

In the protocols of a certain Feldwebel (Sergent) S., who was stationed first in the Soviet Union and then in France, S. argued that the Wehrmacht does have a “*legal right of revenge*” against the civilian population in case of Germans dying. S. sitting in Fort Hunt as POW explains his thinking to his comrades:

>*Partisans need to be mowed down like every warfaring power has ever done. This is the law! We can only act energetically. (...) I have sworn myself, if we ever occupy France again, we must kill every male Frenchman between 14 and 60. Everyone of them I'll come across, I'll shot. That's what I am doing and that's what everyone of us should do.*

His friends agreed.

From the exchange between between the soldier Friedrich Held and Obergefreiter Walter Langfeld about the topic of anti-Partisan warfare:

> H: Against Partisans, it is different. There, you look front and get shot in the back and then you turn around and get shot from the side. There simply is no Front.
>
> L: Yes, that's terrible. [...] But we did give them hell [""Wir haben sie ganz schön zur Sau gemacht""],
>
> H: Yeah, but we didn't get any. At most, we got their collaborators, the real Partisans, they shot themselves before they were captures. The collaborators, those we interrogated.
>
> L: But they too didn't get away alive.
>
> H: Naturally. And when they captured one of ours, they killed him too.
>
> L: You can't expect anything different. It's the usual [Wurscht ist Wurscht]
>
> H: But they were no soldiers but civilians.
>
> L: They fought for their homeland.
>
> H: But they were so deceitful...

The framing is clear here: The distinction between civilians and partisans is basically a moot point because of the deceitfulness of both of them and because they belong to a group that has been painted as *en gros dangerous*. That's how people like Held, Langfeld, and so many others could justify shooting women and children – the group they belonged to was dangerous by itself. “*That people weren't equal was evident to them*”, as Welzer writes.

Welzer further describes that Nazism even managed to incorporate an individual's struggle with their deeds into their frame of reference. They knew that what they were doing was immoral on some level but it was framed in a way where an individual who struggled with what they had to do and did it anyway was perceived as a ""real man"" because he would put the good of the people's community over his own feelings. Hence, when Himmler describes the Holocaust in his Posen speech, he highlights that despite the hard mission that had been given to them by history, they had always remained civilized (anständig). This is a particular nefarious aspect of these mechanism of ideological framing: Wherein overcoming doubt in the face of cruel acts becomes a virtue.

The transformation of a collective of individual's frame of reference doesn't happen overnight and encompasses a social process that is ideologically and politically driven.

It starts with things like newspaper articles about concentration camps in 1933 like [here](http://www.aachener-zeitung.de/polopoly_fs/1.502021.1359128036!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/zva_quer_540/image.jpg) in the Eschweiler Zeitung (a local paper) or [here](http://www.vulture-bookz.de/imagebank/Dokumente/images/1933-03-21~Bekanntmachung_KL_Dachau.jpg) in the Neueste Münchner Nachrichten, both hailing the opening of the Dachau Concentration Camp as the new method to combat those who threaten the German people and the cohesion of their nation while at the same time Jews, socialists and so forth were constantly described as criminals, rapists, and murderers and bringing violence to the German people's community.

It starts with fostering a general suspicion towards all members of certain groups. “*Where the Jew is, is the Partisan and where the Partisan is, is the Jew*”, wrote Nazi official Erich von dem Bach. The ""Jew=Bolshevik=Partisan"" calculus was a central instrument in framing the mass execution carried out by German soldiers as a defensive measure. To throw babies against walls to kill them, became in their minds an action of defense of the whole German people.

That these are in essence social and political process can also be shown with the very examples where the framing was broken by the public. When more and more details about the T4 killing programs of the mentally and physically handicapped emerged in Germany in 1941, public protests formed. Members of the Catholic Church opposed the program and said as much, Hitler was booed at a rally in Bavaria, and locals who lived near the killing centers, as well as families who had members killed, started writing letters – the regime was forced to walk back these measure, stop the centralized killing and instead continued on in secrecy and on a smaller scale.

Similarly in 1943 when the Jewish spouses of German men and women were arrested in Berlin and slated for deportation, their husbands and wives gathered in front of the prison in Rosenstraße and by way of this demonstration forced the Nazi Gauleiter of Berlin to release the arrested again. Far too seldom and few, these protests showed that a public can push back and break these kinds of frames if it can be activate to stand up against these injustices. Regimes that send people into camps, paint certain groups as an essential danger, and undermine the rule of law must depend more strongly on public support than regular democratic regimes ironically. All these things can only be done as long as there is the impression that a majority of the population stands behind them or, at least, won't do anything about it.

Hence, if there is a lesson to be learned from studying historic cruelty, it is that collective cruelty perpetrated by a state and its individual henchmen is a social process that can be disrupted if people start speaking up and demonstrating in the face of it. The current German constitution declares it not only legal but also a duty of every German citizen to resist a government and a regime that violates the principles of inviolable human dignity it enshrines in its first article – a lesson that the historic study of cruelty can only back up.",AskHistorians

I wanted to give you an update and some more help with the next step of determining if there were slaves on this property. I got a lot of great contacts that you guys provided in the comments. I did hear from Justin at the Society of Black Archaeologists. He was very informative and helpful and pointed me in a few directions.

Thank you all so much for the assistance in this I believe some important information can be recorded

Update: Update: hello everyone! I have just finished up my first interview with my uncle a few minutes ago, we talked for about an hour and 20 minutes just about pretty much everything from before he was drafted and how that made him feel then onto his travels from the states to Vietnam, his initial experience in Vietnam such as what he was doing when he got there. From there we started to talk about Him being moved out to the “boondocks” with his unit and then becoming a tunnel rat. 

We then talked about equipment,training and initial feelings of the job. 
- what would be found in the tunnels
- booby traps (the different types)(how they go about finding them)
- time spent in tunnels and what would be a reason he wouldn’t continue 
-injuries 

We talked about a lot! And I was sure to record everything. My plan from here is to take everything we talked about and get a more detailed list of what I want to get more information about.
At the end of our talk today he said he would like to talk more and would tell me “whatever” I wanted to know so I think the plan is to try and do this once a week so I can get as much information about him as possible 
I would love to be able to share everything I find out with everyone! I just have to find out the best way to do that

This was obviously an effect of the revolutionary war, which was fought mostly by volunteer armies. It makes sense all those people kept using guns after the war, and that they taught their children to use guns

However none of those old relatives owns a gun today, and neither does anyone else I know. To buy a gun you have to go to the one gun store in the country, which is owned by the army, and you have to pass all their tests which I'm told are quite strict, and even then they'll only sell you a revolver or a hunting rifle

Clearly Mexico went through a very radical change in gun culture, but no one can tell me when it happened nor how

I've asked my grandparents when and why did people stop buying guns, or when did people stop selling them, and they are not sure. I've asked them when did the law change to make gun ownership more regulated, but again they don't know

I'm baffled. How did Mexico change so much in regards to gun ownership?

edit: Let me give more concrete examples. These come from my family, which is obviously a narrow perspective, but it is the one I have

My grandmother tells me all the men in her family had guns when she was a little girl. She tells me her father always carried two guns because he was ambidextrous and boasted of being able to shoot very precisely with either hand

Her brother (my granduncle) tells me his father gave him a gun when he was fourteen because ""a man must always carry a gun."" In fact the phrase in spanish was ""un hombre siempre debe estar *enpistolado*"" where ""enpistolado"" is a word which specifically means ""to be carrying a gun."" They had a special word for it

They also tell me of meeting old ""adelitas"" (women who fought in the revolution) and that those women still had the habit of carrying guns everywhere they went, and were quite proud of it

Those are examples of the ""gun culture"" which it seems used to exist in Mexico but disappeared in the last 60 to 50 years. Probably other fellow mexicans have similar examples

Today whatever gun culture remains in the country is not as widespread as it once was, and it's either related to hunting as a hobby or it's heavily influenced by organized crime, and most people are not part of either of those things 

edit: About the drug cartels

I have received a few DMs from people saying that there are still tons of guns in Mexico and the drug cartels have them, but that's kinda the point. Guns went from being something everyday people would have to something only criminals have. The only legal form of gun culture is among people who are hunters as a hobby, and most people are not criminals nor hunters

Australia had the [Stolen Generations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Generations). In 1997, a governmental inquiry into this was published, known as the [""Bringing Them Home"" report](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/0708/BringingThemHomeReport#:~:text=On%2026%20May%201997%20the,Home%2C%20was%20tabled%20in%20Parliament.&text=A%20key%20recommendation%20in%20the,by%20policies%20of%20forced%20removal.). The report estimated that between 1 in 10 and 1 in 3 Indigenous Australian children were forcibly taken from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970. These children were then put into the care of Aboriginal missions run by governmental or church groups, which, like the [Canadian residential schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system), were rife with abuse.

I don't think I'm making a leap by asserting that these kinds of sentiments are no longer common (except among the extremely inebriated). Yet, they're not rare at all in the history of letters -- men would write *super* emotional, sentimental letters to their best friends, certainly in the 19th century but also before. I know that it was also common for good friends to share the same bed (Ben Franklin and John Adams), hold hands, and even sit on each other's laps to display affection. 

So what exactly changed in the West between the 19th century and the 21st century that made male friendship so much more restrictive?",AskHistorians

309,1490516922.0,How many 16th century French laying hens would be required to feed Gaston his five dozen eggs?,"This question was [asked on metafilter](http://ask.metafilter.com/307271/No-one-eats-like-Gaston), but we lacked the expertise to give it the appropriate historical context. Indeed, according to [Gaston's poetic testimony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuJTqmpBnI0)*,

>""When I was a lad

>I ate four dozen eggs

>Ev'ry morning to help me get large

>And now that I'm grown

>I eat five dozen eggs

>So I'm roughly the size of a barge!""

With Gaston consuming (60 eggs * 7 days = 420 eggs / week), and [a modern laying hen producing around 4 eggs / week in a backyard environment](http://www.sagehenfarmlodi.com/chooks/chooks.html), we would require a flock of just over a hundred modern hens in prime condition to support adult Gaston's nutritional habits. However, while I imagine that 16th century French laying hens would have been less productive lacking modern breeding, what exactly were their laying rates and how many more would be required?  Gaston appears to be a prominent and prosperous citizen in his village, but how significant would the economic activity required to maintain his breakfast habits be? Also, were the eggs produced by 16th century French hens significantly smaller than modern eggs, thus reducing the Cool-Hand-Luke-esque nature of Gaston's daily challenge, but if so how much smaller?

Similarly, modern chickens will only lay eggs when exposed to the sufficient amounts of light present in the spring and summer months, would there have been feasible ways for 16th century French villagers to convince the chickens they had access to to lay eggs during the late fall/early winter months that Gaston is singing in?",AskHistorians

320,1609802012.0,"""Historians say they were Just Friends, but they were obviously gay!"" What are actual historians' strategies for educating the history of sexuality and gender when the audience is wary of erasure?","I noticed today a post expressing irritation that ""historians"" engage in LGBTQ+ erasure by refusing to acknowledge that various historical figures (or characters from historical literature) were ""gay,"" etc.. I see posts like this a lot on reddit, and they're often reposting comments from other social media, so it seems clear there's a bunch of people out there who believe it's common that historians are participating in the problem of LGBTQ+ erasure.

Now, I know from reading this sub that:

a) Many historians are passionate about the history of sexuality and gender identity and are actively working to undo erasure in both popular conception of history and older historiography.

b) The history of sexuality and gender is complicated and it's rarely correct for a historian to simply say: ""yup, this person was gay/lesbian/trans."" Usually, the accurate answer is a lot more nuanced than applying a modern label, and sometimes ""we can't really know how they identified or who they slept with"" is true even if it's frustrating.

I'm sure it irritates actual historians that they get blamed for erasure when they contribute a lot to undoing erasure. But, it seems that those contributions aren't reaching a lot of people, and I'm sympathetic to the frustration expressed in these posts even if the blame is misplaced. If the nuanced answer *feels like* erasure, then something went wrong in the educational attempt even if it's the most accurate answer.

I'd like to know if historians have strategies for communicating that nuance while avoiding creating feelings of erasure.",AskHistorians

323,1686743607.0,AskHistorians is back up.... but currently 'Restricted'. What this means and why.,"We’re back! Well, almost. As many are aware, as part of the site-wide protests we closed the sub for the past few days. While we have taken the subreddit off of ‘Private’, it remains ‘Restricted’ at this time. This means that no new submissions can be made, and comments are all being removed by a strict Automod code. We know people still have questions, so we’ll be addressing some of them here:
 
**How long will AskHistorians be Restricted?**
 
We don’t have a specific end-date, and reopening is intertwined with several factors which we are continually weighing. These include: what response, if any, we see from reddit; internal discussions by the mod team about how we, as individuals, are feeling about things; consultation with our flaired contributors about how they are feeling about things; and evaluation of the changes that are happening, how they will impact our modding, and how we can adapt to deal with them in a way which allows us to continue to moderate the sub to our exacting standards.
 
**Why are you Restricted? Why not just stay private?**
 
While we went entirely private for two days as part of the reddit-wide blackout, many participants are in favor of a longer period of protest, and so are we. But we want to find a balance to ensure it is as effective as possible, and we believe that reopening in ‘Restricted’ mode does so. It still puts pressure on the Admins by signaling our position, but also allows us to reach a much bigger audience by having this and our previous statements more easily accessible, amplifying the message to more users. 

In addition, it opens up our archives for users to read past answers, but prevents new questions from being asked, which we feel highlights some of the day-to-day work that goes into making AskHistorians the place that it is, but also emphasizes what is being lost when we are unable to run the sub. We do all this because we believe fervently in the wider societal good of making historical knowledge accessible and reliable, and have sought a solution that allows that wider mission to continue while cutting down on the kind of active engagement that matters from a corporate perspective.

**What Happens Next?**

We don’t know what the final results will look like, nor can we make any promises beyond the fact that we will continue to act and be guided in our decisions by what we believe is best for the community. We will continue our internal discussions and evaluations, and provide periodic updates to the community as we deem appropriate. We dearly hope circumstances will allow us to reopen fully very soon.

-------------------

While the above covers the core issue of the Blackout and Locking of the sub, we’ve had a few questions which keep getting asked either in previous Meta threads, or in modmail the past few days, so we’re also addressing them here:

**I completely missed what is happening? Can you fill me in on the background?**

Last month, reddit announced changes to their API which impacts certain third-party apps which provide critical mod tools, especially on mobile. You can find our previous statements [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/146xzgk/meta_tomorrow_askhistorians_will_go_private/). We would also recommend [the recent coverage in the New York Times for a broader look not limited to AskHistorians](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/business/media/reddit-subreddit-blackout-protest.html).

**Can I get access to the subreddit? Pretty please?**

While we have moved the subreddit off of Private, it remains Restricted. In practical terms, only Approved Users can post in a Restricted subreddit, and Approved Users are limited to Mods and Flairs. We understand that many of you have burning questions to ask, and recognize how frustrating it can be when you are searching for an answer, but we are not making exceptions. We hope that we will be able to unlock soon and you’ll be able to ask your question in due course.

**Will you be going somewhere else?**

We have no intentions at this time to pack things up. While its mod tools are very imperfect, reddit provides a unique and unparalleled platform for our community to intersect with many others, both big and small, and all unique and vibrant. There is nowhere else on the internet like reddit. It is where we want to be, and why we want to be able to have constructive engagement with the Admins.
 
We do have an off-reddit footprint though, primarily with the [AskHistorians Podcast](https://www.askhistorians.com/podcast), and are always looking for ways to further expand it in ways that can complement the core of the community here on reddit.

To be sure, ‘Could AskHistorians survive off-reddit?’ is perhaps one of the longest running spitball questions on the mod team, and one which remains without a conclusive answer. We don’t believe this is the death of reddit, nor do we believe this is the death of AskHistorians on reddit. So we’re aiming to still be right here. But what we can promise to the community is that if it looks like reddit might no longer be viable, either now or in the future, we certainly will do everything in our power to ensure that this community survives, whether on a new platform, or by going at it alone (but not Lemmy. Please stop asking).

**My question isn’t answered here….**

While Automod is removing comments, we will not be locking this thread.

Chaucer wrote the Tales starting in about 1385. I'm having a harder time finding dates for ""Sir Gawain"" but it looks like the consensus is sometime between 1360 and 1390. Given that these two works were written well within the same lifetime (although by different authors) and ostensibly in the same language, I'm having trouble understanding why I, a fluent reader of modern English, can understand ~90% of the Tales but maybe 50% of Sir Gawain.

For instance, the first four lines of the Tales are spelled weird by modern standards, but the words are instantly recognizable:
>Whan that Aprill, with his shoures soote

>The droghte of March hath perced to the roote

>And bathed every veyne in swich licour,

>Of which vertu engendred is the flour

Meanwhile, the first four lines of Sir Gawain contain a lot of words that either don't appear in modern English or have different meanings (sithen, sege, sesed, brittened, brondeg, etc.), in addition to pretty big spelled differences (askez->ashes).
>SIÞEN þe sege and þe assaut watz sesed at Troye,

>Þe borȝ brittened and brent to brondeȝ and askez,

>Þe tulk þat þe trammes of tresoun þer wroȝt

>Watz tried for his tricherie, þe trewest on erþe

However, being an Asian American male, I still find Asian accents unattractive - in general the morphemes sound more ""crass"" and ""rough,"" almost comical, as opposed to British/French accents which sound polished or aristocratic. Speaking purely empirically, I've heard people say ""wow that British accent is so hot"" but never the same for Chinese accents.

I'm curious whether this is ONLY a function of trained historical associations that have been implanted in our culture, or if the human ear possesses a natural ""liking"" for certain phonetic structures and will classify those sounds as ""auditorily pleasing"" while ""disliking"" other phonetic combinations. In other words, if Asians hadn't been demonized in American culture, would we still naturally find Asian accents unattractive (a la the bouba/kiki effect where certain sounds are automatically mapped to round or sharp shapes - maybe a similar mapping exists for ""pleasing"" vs ""unpleasing"" accents?)

Though the climb is apparently somewhat difficult ([link](https://bulguides.com/how-difficult-is-mount-olympus/)) I find it hard to believe that no one managed to scale the mountain in the thousand or so years of Ancient Greece. If you reached the peak, it would have become immediately obvious that the twelve Olympian gods - Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes and Dionysus - did not live on this mountain.

The same question also goes for the mountain which the Titans are said to have lived on during their war against the Olympians, Mount Othrys (which is both smaller, at 1.7 kilometres, and easier to climb). Obviously there would be no ""Titanic"" artefacts present on its peak.

Did the Ancient Greeks climb these legendary mountains? Are there any ancient sources expressing confusion regarding the apparent lack of gods on them? Do Ancient Greek authors offer any additional insight?",AskHistorians
360,1510402972.0,Big boys don't cry: when became strong emotions in men unmanly?,"So I was reading The Song of Roland (ca. 1040-1115), and when Roland sees his men lying dead on the battlefield, he falls into a swoon. Seeing him, the archbishop ""feels such great sorrow as he never felt before"". A little while later, Roland swoons yet again because of overwhelming emotion.

This reminded me of the Alliterative Morte Arthure, especially the moment Arthur sees that Gawain has been slain. He cries, kisses his dead friend, swoons, cries some more, is told to get a grip on himself and swoons again. 

A much later example would be the Romance poets and authors, who are also very sensitive to strong emotions. Like the romance knights, they have to stay in control of their sorrow or happiness, but being easily overwhelmed is not seen as a bad thing.

Today, there are voices that call for (much needed) acceptance of men's emotionality, but it is still kind of taboo. I was wondering when and why this changed in western society.

""Legionaries also ate like pigs before a campaign. Fat legionaries were not unfit; they were ready for a long hard march into enemy lands, and were looked on favourably by their centurions. It was far easier to carry extra rations as body-fat inside the men. They would still eat on campaign, but they would have reserves to carry them through any days of short rations or poor foraging.

* Fahrenheit 451 (maybe not intended as political but interpreted that way)

All of these novels were published in the early-to-mid 1900s, and 4 out of the 7 were published in a single 5-year period, 1949-1954 (!).

Today's post will be a bit longer than previous posts because of the topic: Holocaust Denial and how to combat it.

It's a rather specific topic but in recent weeks, we have noticed a general uptick of Holocaust Denial and ""JAQing"" in this sub and with the apparently excellent movie [Denial](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4645330/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) coming out soon, we expect further interest.

We have previously and at length argued [why we don't allow Holocaust denial or any other forms of revisionism under our civility rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ijkk9/rules_roundtable_10_civility_and_debating_with/) but the reasons for doing so will – hopefully – also become more apparent in this post. At the same time, a post like this seemed necessary because we do get questions from people who don't ascribe to Holocaust Denial but have come in contact with their propaganda and talking points and want more information. As we understand this sub to have an educational mission and to be a space with the purpose of presenting informative, in-depth, and comprehensive information to people seeking it, we are necessarily dedicated to values such as the pursuit of of historical truth and imparting historical interpretations based on fact and good faith.

With all that in mind, it felt appropriate to create a post like this where we discuss what Holocaust Denial is, what its methods and background are, what information we have so far comprised on some of its most frequent talking point, and how to combat it further as well as invite our user to share their knowledge and perspective, ask questions, and discuss further. So, without further ado, let's dive into the topic.

# Part 1: Definitions

## What is the Holocaust?

As a starting point, it is important to define what is talked about here. Within the relevant scholarly literature and for the purpose of this post, the term Holocaust is defined as the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of approximately six million Jews and up to half a million Roma, Sinti, and other groups persecuted as ""gypsies"" by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. It took place at the same time as other atrocities and crimes such as the Nazis targeting other groups on grounds of their perceived ""inferiority"", like  the disabled and Slavs, and on grounds of their religion, ideology or behavior among them Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses and homosexuals. During their 12-year reign, the conservative estimate of victims of Nazi oppression and murder numbers 11 million people, though newer studies put that number at somewhere between 15 and 20 million people.

## What is Holocaust Denial?

Holocaust Denial is the attempt and effort to negate, distort, and/or minimize and trivialize the established facts about the Nazi genocides against Jews, Roma, and others with the goal to rehabilitate Nazism as an ideology.

Because of the staggering numbers given above, the fact that the Nazi regime applied the tools at the disposal of the modern state to genocidal ends, their sheer brutality, and a variety of other factors, the ideology of Nazism and the broader historical phenomenon of Fascism in which Nazism is often placed, have become – rightfully so – politically tainted. As and ideology that is at its core racist, anti-Semitic, and genocidal, Nazism and Fascism have become politically discredited throughout most of the world.

Holocaust Deniers seek to remove this taint from the ideology of Nazism by distorting, ignoring, and misrepresenting historical fact and thereby make Nazism and Fascism socially acceptable again. In other words, Holocaust Denial is a form of political agitation in the service of bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism.

In his book *Lying about Hitler* Richard Evans summarizes the following points as the most frequently held beliefs of Holocaust Deniers:

> (a) The number of Jews killed by the Nazis was far less than 6 million; it amounted to only a few hundred thousand, and was thus similar to, or less than, the number of German civilians killed in Allied bombing raids.
>
> (b) Gas chambers were not used to kill large numbers of Jews at any time.
>
> (c) Neither Hitler nor the Nazi leaderhsip in general had a program of exterminating Europe's Jews; all they wished to do was to deport them to Eastern Europe.
>
> (d) ""The Holocaust"" was a myth invented by Allied propaganda during the war and sustained since then by Jews who wished to use it for political and financial support for the state of Israel or for themselves. The supposed evidence for the Nazis' wartime mass murder of millions of Jews by gassing and other means was fabricated after the war.

[Richard Evans: *Lying about Hitler. History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial*, New York 2001, p. 110]

## Part 2: What are the methods of Holocaust Denial?

The methods of how Holocaust Deniers try to achieve their goal to distort, minimize, or outright deny historical fact vary. One thing though that needs to be stressed from the very start is that Holocaust Deniers are not legitimate historians. Historians engage in interpretation of historical events and phenomena based on the facts found in sources. Holocaust Deniers on the other hand seek to bend, obfuscate, and explain away facts to fight their politically motivated interpretation.

Since the late 70s and early 80s, Holocaust Deniers have sought to give themselves an air of legitimacy in the public eye. This includes copying the format and techniques used by legitimate historians and in that process label themselves not as deniers but as ""revisionists"". This is not a label they deserve. As Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman point out in their book *Denying History*:

> Historians are the ones who should be described as revisionists. To receive a Ph.D. and become a professional historian, one must write an original work with research based on primary documents and new sources, reexamining or reinterpreting some historical event—in other words, revising knowledge about that event only. This is not to say, however, that revision is done for revision’s sake; it is done when new evidence or new interpretations call for a revision.
>
> Historians have revised and continue to revise what we know about the Holocaust. But their revision entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.

> Holocaust deniers claim that there is a force field of dogma around the Holocaust—set up and run by the Jews themselves—shielding it from any change. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether or not the public is aware of the academic debates that take place in any field of study, Holocaust scholars discuss and argue over any number of points as research continues. Deniers do know this.

Rather, the Holocaust Deniers' modus operandi is to use arguments based on half-truths, falsification of the historical record, and innuendo to misrepresent the historical record and sow doubt among their audience. They resort to fabricating evidence, the use of pseudo-academic argumentation, cherry-picking of sources, outrageous and not supported interpretation of sources, and emotional claims of far-reaching conspiracy masterminded by Jews.

Let me give you an example of how this works that is also used by Evans in *Lying about Hitler*, p. 78ff.: David Irving, probably one of the world's most prominent Holocaust Deniers, has argued for a long time that Hitler was not responsible for the Holocaust, even going so far as to claim that Hitler did not know about Jews being killed. This has been the central argument of his book *Hitler's War* published in 1977 and 1990 (with distinct differences, as in the 1990 edition going even further in its Holocaust Denial). In the 1977 edition on page 332, Irving writes that Himmler

> was summoned to the Wolf's Lair for a secret conference with Hitler, at which the fate of Berlin's Jews was clearly raised. At 1.30 PM Himmler was obliged to telephone from Hitler's bunker to Heydrich the explicit order that Jews were *not to be liquidated* [Italics in the original]

Throughout the rest of the book in its 1977 edition and even more so in its 1990s edition, Iriving kept referring to Hitler's ""November 1941 order forbidding the liquidation of Jews"" and in his introduction to the book wrote that this was ""incontrovertible evidence"" that ""Hitler ordered on November 30, 1941, that there was to be ‚no liquidation‘ of the Jews."" [*Hitler's War*, 1977, p. xiv].

Let's look at what the phone log actually says. Kept in the German Bundesarchiv under the signature NS 19/1438, Telefonnotiz Himmler v. 30.11.1941:

> Verhaftung Dr. Jekelius (Arrest of Dr. Jekelius)
>
> Angebl. Sohn Molotov; (Supposed son of Molotov)
>
> Judentransport aus Berlin. (Jew-transport from Berlin.)
>
> keine Liquidierung (no liquidation)

Richard Evans remarks about this [p. 79] that it is clear to him as well as any reasonable person reading this document that the order to not liquidate refers to one transport, not – as Irving contends – all Jews. This is a reasonable interpretation of this document backed up further when we apply basic historiographical methods as historians are taught to do.

On November 27, we know from documents by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (the national German railway), that there was indeed a deportation train of Berlin Jews to Riga. We know this, not just because the fact that this was a deportation train is backed up by the files of the Berlin Jewish community but because the Reichsbahn labels it as such and the Berlin Gestapo had given an order for it.

We also know that the order for no liquidation for this transport arrived too late. The same day as this telephone conversation took place, the Higher SS and Police Leader of Latvia, Friedrich Jeckeln, reported that the Ghetto of Riga had been cleared of Latvian Jews and also that about one thousand German Jews from this transport had been shot along with them. This lead to a lengthy correspondence between Jeckeln and Himmler with Himmler reprimanding Jeckeln for shooting the German Jews.

A few days earlier, on November 27, German Jews also had been shot in great numbers in Kaunas after having been deported there.

Furthermore, neither the timeline nor the logic asserted by Irving match up when it comes to this document. We know from Himmler's itinerary that he met Hitler after this phone conversation took place, not before as Irving asserts. Also, if Hitler – as Irving posits – was not aware of the murder of the Jews, how could he order their liquidation to be stopped?

Now, what can be gleaned from this example are how Holocaust Deniers like Irving operate:

* In his discussion and interpretation of the document, Irving takes one fragment of the document that fits his interpretation: ""no liquidation"".

* He leaves out another fragments preceding it that is crucial to understand the meaning of this phrase: ""Jew-transport from Berlin.""

* He does not place the document within the relevant historical context: That there was a transport from Berlin, whose passengers were not to be shot in contradiction to passengers of an earlier transport and to later acts of murder against German Jews.

* He lies about what little context he gave for the document: Himmler met Hitler after the telephone conversation rather than before.

* And based on all that, he puts forth a historical interpretation that while it does not match the historical facts, it matches his ideological conclusions: Hitler ordered the murder of Jews halted – a conclusion that does not even fit his logic that Hitler didn't know about the murder of Jews.

A reasonable and legitimate interpretation of this document and the ongoings surrounding it is put forth by Christian Gerlach in his book *Krieg, Ernährung, Völkermord*. p. 94f. Gerlach argues that the first mass shooting of German Jews on November 27, 1941 had caused fear among the Nazi leadership that details concerning the murder of German Jews might become public. In order to avoid a public outcry similar to that against the T4 killing program of the handicapped. For this reason, they needed more time to figure out what to do with the German Jews and arrived at the ultimate conclusion to kill them under greater secrecy in camps such as Maly Trostinecz and others.

## Part 3: How do I recognize  and combat Holocaust Denial

# Recognizing Denial

From the above given example, not only the methods of Holocaust Deniers become clear but also, that it can be very difficult for a person not familiar with the minutiae of the history of the Holocaust to engage or even recognize Holocaust Denial. This is exactly a fact, Holocaust Deniers are counting on when spreading their lies and propaganda.

So how can one as a lay person recognize Holocaust Denial?

Aside from an immediate red flag that should go up as soon as people start talking about Jewish conspiracies, winner's justice, and supposed ""truth"" suppressed by the mainstream, any of the four points mentioned about Holocaust Denier's beliefs above should also ring alarm bells immediately.

Additionally, there is a number of authors and organizations that are well known as Holocaust Deniers. Reading their names or them being quoted in an affirmative manner are also sure fire signs of Holocaust Denial. The authors and organizations include but are not limited to: The Institute for Historical Review, the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust, David Irving, Arthur Butz, Paul Rassinier, Fred Leuchter, Ernst Zündel, and William Carto.

Aside all these, anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric are an integral part of almost all Holocaust Denial literature. I previously mentioned the Jewish conspiracy trope but when you suddenly find racist, anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, and white supremacists rhetoric in a media that otherwise projects historical reliability it is a sign that it is a Holocaust Denier publication.

Similarly, there are are certain argumentative strategies Holocaust Deniers use. Next to the obvious of trying to minimize the numbers of people killed et. al., these include casting doubt on eyewitness testimony while relying on eyewitness testimony that helps their position, asserting that post-war confessions of Nazis were forced by torture, or some numbers magic that might seem legit at first but becomes really unconvincing once you take a closer look at it.

In short, recognizing Holocaust Denial can be achieved the best way if one approaches it like one should approach many things read: By engaging its content and assertions critically and by taking a closer look at the arguments presented and how they are presented. If someone like Irving writes that Hitler didn't know about the Holocaust, yet ordered it stopped in 1941, as a reader one should quickly arrive at the conclusion that he has some explaining to do.

# How do we combat Holocaust Denial

Given how Holocaust denial is part of a political agenda pandering bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism, combating it needs to take into account this context and any effective fight against Holocaust Denial needs to be a general fight against bigotry, racism, and anti-Semitism.

At the same time, it is important to know that the most effective way of fighting them and their agenda is by engaging their arguments rather than them. This is important because any debate with a Holocaust Denier is a debate not taking place on the same level. As Deborah Lipstadt once wrote: ""[T]hey are contemptuous of the very tools that shape any honest debate: truth and reason. Debating them would be like trying to nail a glob of jelly to the wall. (...) We must educate the broader public and academe about this threat and its historical and ideological roots. We must expose these people for what they are.""

In essence, someone who for ideological reasons rejects the validity of established facts is someone with whom direct debates will never bear any constructive fruits. Because when you do not even share a premise – that facts are facts – arguing indeed becomes like nailing a pudding to the wall.

So, what can we do? 

Educate ourselves, educate others, and expose Holocaust Deniers as the racist, bigots and anti-Semites they are. There is a good reason Nazism is not socially acceptable as an ideology – and there is good reason it should stay that way. Because it is wrong in its very essence. The same way Holocaust Denial is wrong at its very core. Morally as well as simply factually.

Thankfully, there are scores of resources out there, where anybody interested is able to educate and inform themselves. The [United States Holocaust Memorial Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/) has resources as well as a whole encyclopedia dedicated to spread information about the Holocaust. Emory University Digital Resource Center has its [The Holocaust on Trial Website](https://www.hdot.org/) directly addressing many of the myths and lies spread by Holocaust Deniers and providing a collection of material used in the Irving v. Lipstadt trial. The [Jewish Virtual Library](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/denial1.html) as well as the – somewhat 90s in their aesthetics – [Nizkor Project](http://www.nizkor.org/) also provide easily accessible online resources to inform oneself about claims of Holocaust Deniers. (And there is us too! Doing our best to answer the questions you have!)

Another very important part of fighting Holocaust Denial is to reject the notion that this is a story ""that has two sides"". This is often used to give these people a forum or argue that they should be able to somehow present their views to the public. It is imperative to not walk into this fallacious trap. There are no two sides to one story here. There are people engaging in the serious study of history who try to find a variety of perspectives and interpretation based on facts conveyed to us through sources. And then there are Holocaust Deniers who use lies, distortion, and the charge of conspiracy. These are not two sides of a conversation with equal or even slightly skewed legitimacy. This is people engaging in serious conversations and arguments vs. people whose whole argument boils down to ""nuh-uh"", ""it's that way because of the Jews"" and ""lalalala I can't hear you"". When one ""side"" rejects facts en gros not because they can disprove them, not because they can argue that they aren't relevant or valid but rather because they don't fit their bigoted world-view, they cease to be a legitimate side in a conversation and become the equivalent of a drunk person yelling ""No, you!"" but in a slightly more sophisticated and much more nefarious way.

The biggest disconnect I’ve encountered, both as a student and as a private citizen, is how either side of the aisle gives a different, sweeping statement regarding southern military power. White supremacists and victims of revisionist propaganda tend to suggest that the South was militarily superior but lost due to a myriad of innane excuses and vague references to “logistics.” At the same time, non-apologists suggest that victory was inevitable but merely delayed by surprise victories early on in the war.

So, given that history very very rarely boils down to such reductionist explanations, what is the truth behind this? Did the South stand a chance? Did the North ever stand to lose?

427,1621794518.0,[META] Loaded questions that are not exactly soapboxing but have premises that cannot be verified by a historian.,"First, I want to express my gratitude to the team moderating this sub - we can all agree that your work and attitude makes r/askhistorians undoubtedly the best place on Reddit.

This being said, I have a “meta” concern that does not seem to have been addressed in the rules but makes me feel uneasy. This post is my way to draw attention to this issue:

Two of the most popular recent posts on the subreddit seem to have what I would call a dubious premise:

Topic 1: [How did tracksuits (especially the ones with stripes on their sides) become an inherent part of Russian/East Slavic culture?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ndpx06/how_did_tracksuits_especially_the_ones_with/)
Topic 2: [Why didn't most people in Muslim-majority countries grow detached from religion like they often did in Christian-majority countries?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/nj60qb/why_didnt_most_people_in_muslimmajority_countries/)

While I understand that I am not a source, the premise of Topic 1 seems very difficult to substantiate. How does OP know that Adidas is “inherent part” of Slavic culture? This question seems to be based on a popular meme that pokes fun at stereotypes about Eastern Europeans. The question in practice fails to see the difference between stereotypes, culture and current social facts. Frankly, suggesting that this stereotype is anything but an internet joke making fun of an old fashion trend felt unpleasantly dismissive.

Of course the very educated answers in the thread focused on why the Adidas apparel brand was popular in the 90s - which is a fair approach to the history of that brand in Eastern Europe. At first I expected answers to mention the fact that the stereotype stated by OP as the “truth” may be faulty, but then I realised that people who answer may not be qualified to comment on or even spot the dubious premise. 

The reason is that the premise is not historical but cultural or sociological. A historian is not expected to know the current cultural background of a country or a region, or a group of people. The question is historical but the premise is current. So historians, being focused on history, cannot say whether the premise is true or false. They just identify the topic and tell its history. 

To give a more sinister example: OP may have asked why rape is a part of the culture of nation X. A historian has no way to tell whether rape currently plays any role in the culture of nation X but can tell what is the history of rape in that country. A historian is rarely equipped (nor is he expected to) to discuss the harmful stereotype portrayed as true in current popular discourse.

Of course, when discussing tracksuits, the topic is lighthearted and fun, so no harm done - just raised eyebrows. When religion is involved, however, the stereotypes pushed in the premises of questions may be more troublesome

Topic 2 - which is currently this sub’s top post - is much more worrying, as it reinforces what seems to be a harmful stereotype that the Muslim world is more religious and - as a result - as certain orange politicians would have you believe, not as “advanced”. It suggests that OP has collected data on religious attitudes and various group affiliations in the immensely huge “Muslim” world and reached the conclusion that Tunisians, for example, are more religious than Chileans. It is a premise that cannot be verified and just reinforces a stereotype. I know, again, that I am not a source but I know quite a lot of people from Muslim communities all over the world. None of them is overtly “religious”, while most are unabashed atheists. So a question I would ask in the subreddit would be “What made Muslim communities so atheistic compared to Orthodox Christian communities, which in my subjective experience, are extremely religious?”. I have no way of knowing how rampant atheism is in Muslim-majority countries - so my hypothetical question is as valid as today’s top thread in the sub. 

As with the Adidas question, I do not expect actual historians to be in a position to refute the premise raised by OP. A historian is best equipped to identify the topic (development of religious attitudes in Muslim-majority countries through history) and write about this. A historian has no way of comparing current religious attitudes between, for example, Azerbaijan and Mongolia.

My point here is that some questions can reinforce harmful stereotypes - even if the asker and the replying historians have the best of intentions. While this is not exactly soapboxing, as there is no malicious intent, it is still a troubling issue.

I am not sure how it can be addressed but I feel that it may pose serious problems to the sub down the road.

This is from me -hope this helps.

How did this image change take place after the war? Has his image even changed at all?,"Disclaimer first – obviously this post is not to glorify Mussolini or his deeds in any way. But after reading about [Stalin's impressive language proficiencies yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hziy70/stalin_reportedly_feigned_a_total_lack_of_english/) I got curious about contemporary leaders and stumbled upon Mussolini. Apparently (if we take his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini#Personal_life) for granted), for example, at the Munich Conference (1938) he was the only participant to be able to speak anything other than his native language, sufficiently enough to not need an interpreter even. Also with him being a Socialist in his youth he was obviously well-versed in Socialist literature and philosophy and he apparently was an avid admirer of Nietzsche, among others.

Now in my impression Mussolini today is often portrayed as rather, well, simple-minded and certainly not intellectual in any way so I was rather surprised to find out about all this – especially since I had to read that he actively had himself portrayed as an intellectual by fascist government propaganda.

So –

* Am I right in my feeling that Mussolini's image has changed after the war – both in Italy and abroad?
* If his image has indeed changed – why? (I have yet another feeling this is at least partly because of his somewhat ridiculous visual rhetoric performance which has been parodied in Chaplin's The Great Dictator, but I'm certainly far from 100% right on this.)",AskHistorians

This is Part 1, on learning and knowledge exchange in AskHistorians.","#“I didn’t know I had the same question until I heard someone else ask it.”

About a year and a half ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6790qv/meta_why_do_you_readparticipate_in_askhistorians/) thread asking why you participate in AskHistorians. That thread, follow-up interviews, and a whole lot of lurking became the basis for half my PhD dissertation in which I explored why people participate in online communities. If you want to see the dissertation in all of its 300+ page glory, you can access it [here](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0372890). At long last, I’m sharing some of the results of this work through a series of three posts – this is the first. Since AskHistorians is a place to learn about history, this post discusses what and how we learn through participation, and some of the challenges faced by the sub when it comes to knowledge exchange. The next will discuss AskHistorians’ position on reddit and the last the experiences of the mods. But before I get into the results, I want to provide a bit of background information first.

**Methodology**

The methodology I used to learn about participation in AskHistorians was somewhat ethnographic and results were derived from a variety of sources, such as: 

* **Interviews**: I conducted in-depth interviews with 18 AskHistorians community members as well as exchanged emails and private messages with an additional 4 people. The interviews lasted an average of an hour and thirteen minutes. 9 were with mods (plus 3 former mods), 6 had flair, and 4 were lurkers. 
* **My recruitment post**
* **Observational data**: It was my job for a while to read AskHistorians posts. Not gonna lie– it was pretty awesome! While I read a lot of questions and answers, I mostly read Meta posts, Monday Methods, as well as the round table discussions on AskHistorians’ rules. 
* **A full comment log** of a highly upvoted and controversial post that included removed comments
* **Secondary literature**: I drew from news media, blogs, and peer reviewed literature written about reddit. I also used sources created by AskHistorians' mods themselves, such as conference presentations and [this podcast](https://askhistorians.libsyn.com/askhistorians-podcast-100-meta-askhistorians-under-the-hood) (which you should totally listen to if you haven't yet). 

To analyze the interview data, I used a process known as coding where I read (and reread over and over again) the interviews looking for common themes to describe and explain why my participants were motivated to participate in different ways. If needed I pulled in observational data and secondary literature to supplement and sometimes explain what I had learned through the interviews. For example, if a participant recalled a particular thread, I would read it to understand more about the context of their recollection. 
 
Coding can be a pretty subjective process, so to help identify and mitigate bias I engaged in a process referred to as reflexivity, in which researchers examine how their beliefs, values, identity, and moral stance affect the work they do. A brief introduction to positionality can be found [here](https://weingartenlrc.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/research-writing-whats-your-positionality/). Since my position relative to the topic I’m discussing is different for each post, I’ve included a section on positionality in each one. Of relevance to this post is my experience as an AskHistorians user. I’ve been a lurker since I discovered the sub in 2012. I have a bachelor’s degree in history, so when I first found AskHistorians, I thought I might be able to provide an answer or two, but quickly realized I had nowhere near the expertise as other community members. Thus, as someone with an interest in history but not the level of knowledge required for answering questions, I found that I shared a lot of the same learning experiences as the other lurkers I interviewed. 

One more quick note before I move onto the results. The quotes I’ve used mostly come from the interviews, but I’ve also included a few public and removed comments. Public comments are linked and attributed to the user who made them. Removed comments are not attributed to anyone and are quoted with all spelling/grammar errors retained. I contacted interview participants whose quotes I’ve included and let them choose how they wanted to be attributed in the posts, e.g., with their first name, username, or pseudonym. If I didn’t hear back I used a pseudonym.  

Now, without further ado, the results! 

**Learning through participation in AskHistorians**

One of the things I love about AskHistorians, and that was reflected in the interviews and meta posts, is that learning through the sub is so often serendipitous. Some variation of: “I didn’t know I had the same question until I heard someone ask it,” was a common refrain. Often this statement was made in reference to learning new topics. The people I interviewed described how they would have never thought to ask about things like the history of strawberry pin cushions, how soldiers treated acne during wartime, or succession in the Mongolian Empire. However, serendipitous learning was also expressed by experts with regards to their own areas of expertise as well. For example, several participants, such as flaired user, u/frogbrooks, described how questions encouraged them to look into their own subject areas from a different angle or take a deep dive into an area they’d previously overlooked:

>A couple of the responses I’ve written have opened doors to new topics that I otherwise wouldn’t have read much about, but ended up being extremely interesting.

Another recurring theme was that AskHistorians made learning about history accessible. Several participants described having an interest in history, but not necessarily the means to get into it in any depth. For example, some didn’t have access to primary or secondary resources, while others described not having the time or energy to try to search through books to find the exact information they wanted. Accessibility was not only important to people who wanted to learn more about history but couldn’t– it was also important to those who thought they hated history based on how it had been taught in school. The interesting questions and engaging writing styles of AskHistorians’ panel of experts helped some of the people I interviewed realize they actually liked history after all, such as lurker, KR: 

>All the history taught in class beyond the ancient Greeks was super duper boring . . . [but] it turns out I actually really love history, and the sub made me see that. 

Not too surprisingly, learning about the past was important to everyone I interviewed; this is, after all, a sub dedicated to discussing history. However, new historical knowledge was not the only thing participants gained. For example, people described learning more about how history is practiced professionally, and the methods historians use. This was expressed not only by total history novices, but also by those who majored in history, such as Jim: 

>I’m learning more from Reddit on historiography than [from] my teachers. 

Jim’s statement also reflects my own experience: as a history major (albeit 15 years ago) I also learned more about historiography and historical methods from AskHistorians than I did during my degree. On the other side of the coin, AskHistorians also provided experts with a way to learn more about how the broader public understands history. For example, u/CommodoreCoCo, a PhD student, said:

>I’ve really learned a lot about how the public perceives history and how, in some ways, it’s been taught to them incorrectly and what misconceptions they have, which is absolutely important if we want to interact with them better and teach them better and train better historians for the future.

In AskHistorians, experts and laypeople come together and meet each other’s needs: laypeople learn things they want to know from experts, which illuminates for experts topic areas that are missing or need to be better addressed.  

While most people described learning new information through participation in AskHistorians, several described learning more about other things, such as negative aspects of human nature. These lessons were not learned after discovering terrible things people did in the past; rather, participants described learning them by seeing the prevalence of racism, sexism, and bigotry on reddit as well as seeing how questions reflect biases, often in an attempt to justify bigotry. Each of the people I spoke to who described learning more about the negative aspects of human nature were mods. For example, when asked what he’d learned, Josh responded: 

>I guess I’d had a rosy-eyed view of humanity and thinking that people are mostly good. And I do think that people are mostly good, but I didn’t think that people could be so malicious. I don’t know if I want to go so far as to say evil, but hurtful to other people and that’s one of the sadder things, but I think it’s one of those things that have made me more mature as a person.

However, non-mods were among those who described learning how to detect bias in question asking, such as Oliver: 

 >after a while you get used to the moderators or the person responding saying, ‘you’ve made this assumption here and this is how the question should be stated in my opinion’ and that’s one thing that’s helped me being able to recognize a loaded question, because I find myself often asking, not just in history but in other situations in life . . . [learning to detect bias is] one way that’s helped me in this turbulent time, kind of go, what is this person really saying: is he making underlying assumptions or questions or anything like that? It’s a helpful tool.

**Why learning about history is important to AskHistorians users**

When I asked participants why learning about history was important, a common response was that learning about the past provided a way to better understand the present. Participants described wanting to know why things are the way they are, and then going back and back and back– deep down that rabbit hole I’m sure many of us know all too well. Further, participants, such as Oliver, were also hopeful that learning about the past would help make the present world a better place: 

>I just kind of look around and go man, if everybody just knew the history of this or that, or of this family or the history of their neighbourhood, things would be so much better!

Learning through participation in AskHistorians was described in overwhelmingly positive terms, even when learning more about negative aspects of human nature, which, for example, was often described as contributing to personal growth. 

One last thing I want to highlight before I move on to describing why participants share their expertise is that the learning that happens through participation in AskHistorians is social. We learn not only from what the experts tell us in response to questions, through debate, or in requests for follow up information, but also by watching them in action. Oliver’s quote above showcases how practical, real-life tools, like detecting bias, are learned by watching mods and flairs in action. The “teaching” side isn’t always intentional, overt, nor require subject-specific expertise, and the learning that happens in the sub extends well beyond history. 

**Why participants share their expertise**

Needless to say, while learning through participation on AskHistorians may not always be about history, it is most of the time. Therefore, the sub’s success depends on the contributions of experts. The reasons for sharing expertise were varied, and participants often described several factors that motivated them to share. First, participants described sharing expertise purely because they can, a sentiment known as self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997). For many participants, self-efficacy changed over time. Some described feeling more comfortable answering questions on a wider range of topics as they learned more through school or on their own. Conversely, others described learning more and realizing how much they *didn’t* know, thereby decreasing self-efficacy and their comfort responding to questions. In one case, a participant revoked his topic-specific flair in favour of the more general, “quality contributor flair.” And on the subject of flair, getting it was also important to several participants who saw the merit-based process of earning flair as representative of a history of high-quality contributions. These participants described flair as an important mode of recognition for having knowledge in their subject area and for their contributions to the community. 

Another motivation for contributing expertise was seeing errors that needed to be corrected. Correcting errors was also often the impetus that inspired people to make their first ever comment on AskHistorians. For example, when recounting his first post, former mod u/edXcitizen87539319 alluded to the popular [xkcd comic,](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png) saying, 

>It was a case of ‘somebody’s wrong on the internet’ and I had to correct them. 

Similarly, others were encouraged to participate because they saw that they held expertise in a particular topic area that no one else seemed to have, for example, mod, Anna: 

>I realized there wasn’t anybody out there who was going to answer them but me. So, I basically filled a gap that I had self-identified. 

Most of the time gaps were identified in a given topic area. However, one participant saw how he could fill a gap with particular source material: Oliver, who wasn’t a flaired user or mod, had inherited rare books written about a former president, so when a question came up, he was able to use these books to write a response to a question. His answer got accolades from the OP and was shared on that week’s Sunday Digest. 

Self-efficacy, earning flair, correcting errors, and filling gaps were all important motivations for sharing expertise. However, the next two were the most highly valued: helping and bringing enjoyment to others and promoting historical thinking. When people described sharing their knowledge to make people happy, it was often accompanied not only by a sense of personal happiness but also a sense that some good was being done in the world, as is reflected in this quote from u/TRB1783: 

>If I’ve taught someone today, I’ve done a good thing. You know, something in the real world. Something that matters.

Tied in with the idea that teaching people something new is a worthwhile endeavor is that sharing expertise can be used to promote historical thinking, particularly to an audience that may not have in-depth experience with the humanities and historical methods. AskHistorians was viewed, and valued, as a public history site, which I’ll address in detail in the next post. Before that, however, I’d like to quickly touch on some of the challenges of sharing expertise on reddit. 

**Challenges**

Sharing expertise was described as an overwhelmingly positive experience. However, several participants described challenges as well, mostly in the form of rude or aggressive pushback and abuse. Because such comments are often sent via PM or removed by the mods, much of this pushback is unseen by the vast majority of users. Here’s a slightly redacted example of some of this pushback and abuse that was directed at a user who responded to a question: 

>Christ have you ever thought about changing or removing the stick up your ass? Its sad when someone who claims to be a historian can’t seem to remove his perspective and bias from 60 years later and impose it on a historical context . . . because you are such a prissy uptight know it all you feel compelled to place your tight assed point of view onto it. Grow up Sheldon.

Obviously, the people who make comments such as these are responsible for them. However, there are social, cultural, and technical constructs of reddit that enable them. In my next post, I’ll discuss these factors and how they affect participation on AskHistorians.

The general trend is that although the British both contributed to the circumstances that led to the famine, and did a terrible job responding to it, the famine wasn't a deliberate act of mass-murder with the extinction of Catholic Irish as its goal. A tragedy of apathy and economics rather than one of hatred. 

Meanwhile the Ukranian Holodomor's ""genocide question"" seems to be far more heated and readily discussed. What were the core differences in the two situations?

Two years ago, 2001 opened up to questions and we feared we’d be deluged with 9/11 questions and our yearly post was entirely focussed on that. In retrospect, we didn’t get the flood of questions we feared. Last year, when 2002 became available, there wasn’t actually much to ask about because 2002 was a mercifully boring year. But with 2003 there is once again an elephant in the room. We ended last year’s post noting:

> See you next year, when you finally get to ask a million questions about Iraq and whether [insert politician here] is really a war criminal, despite all the other interesting things that happened in 2003.

So let’s get on with this, starting with the other stuff. 

**We Cloned a Horse, Myspace launched, and Britain (Technically) Went to Mars!**


We all remember 2003 primarily for advances in cloning technology, right? I’m sure that was the main thing. May 2003 saw the birth of both the first cloned horse and the first cloned deer. As far as I could find out, both the horse and the deer live relatively uneventful lives in their respective environments. The deer, Dewey, has kids apparently. Anyway, not much actually came of this. 

Ok, so 2003 isn’t remembered for cloning technology. But it is, in part, remembered for being a big year in tech, and particularly space exploration. On the bright side, the Spitzer Space Telescope launched on its mission to survey the sky in the infrared spectrum, the European Space Agency launched its first mission to the Moon, the Hubble Space Telescope began its now iconic Ultra Deep Field survey, and China launched its first manned space mission. The Mars Express mission, named for its uncharacteristically brief design and construction phase, launched carrying an orbiter that is still with us and a British lander called *Beagle 2* that sort of worked. The lander never phoned home after entering the Martian atmosphere, and it was thought the mission had failed and that the lander was a metallic smear among the dunes, but it was spotted by a satellite in 2015 with what seemed to be nothing but a faulty solar panel… that was obstructing the antenna’s deployment. For all we know it carried out all preprogrammed scientific experiments, unable to tell us of the cool stuff it’s found. Oh dear. More seriously, it was the year of the Columbia disaster, when that space shuttle disintegrated and killed all seven astronauts on board. In tech news, Myspace and 4chan both launched in 2003. It also saw the end of the supersonic airliner Concorde. For the chronically online, 2003 was also the first year of Red vs. Blue. 

In global affairs, it was a great year for the European Union as Slovenia, Slovakia, Estonia, Malta, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, and the Czech Republic all decided to join in referendums. The name “Yugoslavia” was finally removed from the map after the last state to use it renamed itself Serbia and Montenegro, though the Prime Minister of Serbia was assassinated shortly after. In Asia, things were taking a turn for the worse. Ethnically charged riots in Cambodia led to Thailand severing diplomatic relations, and North Korea withdrew from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. But the big problem was the emergence of SARS-CoV-1. The World Health Organisation put out warnings in March 2003 of the new virus, which (hard as it might be to believe in our post-Covid world) led to rapid and successful containment measures by governments across the world in April. By July, the WHO was content to declare the epidemic contained, and in the end it only killed 700-800 people. Considering that the sequel disrupted billions of lives and has killed millions, the global response to SARS was a resounding success. “Mission Accomplished”, one might say. Uh oh. 

**Okay Fine, Let’s Talk About Iraq** 

Nobody really associates 2003 with the Beagle 2 mission or the launch of 4chan. Even the demise of the famous Concorde only grabbed the attention of the news cycle for a couple of days in a handful of countries. The fact is, in much of the world, 2003 is associated overwhelmingly with one event: the invasion of Iraq by a coalition led by the United States and United Kingdom. Now, I’m not going to go into much detail because that is best left to historians with the requisite specialization, and I hope they can share their expertise in the comments to this post. What does concern us, as when 9/11 became available for questions, is arguing and misinformation. Infamously, the justifications for the Iraq War were dodgy and it remains a controversial issue, so let’s go over the facts. Fortunately, historians have been blessed by the work of Sir John Chilcot, whose 7 year long enquiry into the Iraq War for the British government resulted in a 12 volume report that is both [publically available](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20171123122743/http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/the-report/) and fantastically thorough, if only for the British side of things. It’s not perfect, but as a medievalist I would give a lot to work with sources that are 1% as revealing as this. 

In the 1990s, Saddam Hussein had failed to comply with UN inspections by obfuscating and destroying evidence, then denying entry to inspectors altogether, so he was up to something that would alarm the international community. Then in 2002 it became clear that Saddam Hussein was rearming and expanding his military. In particular, a surge of activity surrounding ballistic missile development had caught the attention of the UN. Given Hussein’s historical belligerence, this set off alarm bells at the UN Security Council, which passed Resolution 1441 in response calling on Iraq to disarm. Both US President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair gave statements in late 2002 urging Iraq to disarm in accordance with the will of the UN Security Council, but over time an unstated “or we will invade” became less and less implied. US Secretary of State Colin Powell was chiefly responsible for making the case against Iraq among the international community in numerous sessions of the UN. By early 2003 it was clear that Hussein had no intention of disarming (though he had agreed to let UN inspectors back in) and that the US would respond to non-compliance by invading Iraq and deposing Hussein’s government with planning for an invasion well underway by the end of 2002. 

But there was something strange going on with the justifications for war. In the US, rhetoric focussed on supposed links between Hussein and the 9/11 attacks. This had a profound effect on public opinion. Polling in 2003 found that around 45% of US citizens believed Hussein had personal involvement in 9/11, though the BBC reported that it was as high as 70% in a piece from September 2003. Polling also found that it was widely thought in the US that most of the 9/11 hijackers were Iraqi. None of this was true and the folks in charge knew it, but senior politicians - especially Vice President Dick Cheney - pushed it hard to the dismay of the intelligence community. In case it needs to be made any clearer, Saddam Hussein did not plan 9/11. Bush, Cheney, and Powell were lying when they suggested he did. 

The stuff about weapons of mass destruction was also fishy. The main evidence discussed publicly by the US revolved around documents suggesting the sale of uranium to Iraq from Niger and the purchase of large amounts of aluminium tubing which, the US alleged, would be used to enrich the uranium purchased from Niger. Problem is, the Institute for Science and International Security concluded the tubing probably couldn’t be used for uranium enrichment and the International Atomic Energy Agency quickly spotted that the documents claiming to show the sale of uranium were forgeries. 

In the UK, claims of Hussein’s WMDs revolved around an intelligence report released in September 2002 and another in February 2003 that was so full of holes it became known as the “Dodgy Dossier” in the British press. Prime Minister Tony Blair and US Secretary of State Colin Powell praised it as solid evidence of Hussein’s supposed WMDs, but an investigation the British TV channel *Channel 4* found the report was heavily plagiarized and that its sourcing was abysmal. Although Blair admitted that the report should have attributed its sources better, he stood by it despite its obvious unsuitability as the basis of government policy. As we now know, Saddam Hussein was not proactively developing nuclear or chemical weapons. As it turned out, the regime’s chemical weapons stockpile was from the 1980s or earlier, and there is no evidence that Hussein had a nuclear weapons programme at the time of the invasion. It was also claimed that Iraq had a fleet of drones to deliver such WMDs to American soil, which was nonsense.

Despite clear flaws in the case for war, the invasion began on March 19 2003, though special forces from around the world had been in Iraq for weeks before and the SAS fought a skirmish on March 17 with air support. A bombardment of missiles and air strikes signaled on March 19 that war had begun, including a failed attempt to kill Hussein and his family. Broadly speaking, the plan was for US forces to advance up the Euphrates river on the southern side while UK-led forces did likewise on the northern side. Meanwhile, insurgents were to attack across Iraq while the Kurds opened a front in the north along with coalition paratroopers. Although parts of the invasion did not go as well as planned - notably the city of Basra was expected to surrender quickly but tied down British and Polish forces until April 6 - the Iraqi army crumbled faster than anticipated and what looked like a strong victory was achieved in only one month. On May 1, George Bush famously stood on an aircraft carrier in front of a big banner reading “Mission Accomplished”; an image that has aged like fine milk. In his victory speech, Bush said there was still much work to do. Notably, Saddam Hussein had not been captured, and wouldn’t be until December. 

Was the invasion legal? Well, we are historians and not lawyers so we’re not really qualified to definitively say. The Blair and Bush administrations argued that Resolution 1441 and previous resolutions against Iraq’s rearmament permitted UN members to take whatever military action was necessary to enforce their terms. However, there were *a lot* of government officials arguing privately, and occasionally publicly, that the invasion was a violation of international law. The Dutch government conducted an enquiry to determine the war’s legality for the benefit of their parliament, and found it was illegal. In the UK, when the Chilcot Report was published in 2016, it emerged that there were serious doubts about the legality of the invasion. In particular, the British Foreign Secretary at the time, Jack Straw, argued in a private letter to Tony Blair in 2002 that his understanding of Resolution 1441 was that a new, specific UN mandate for an invasion would be required to make a war legal. The General Secretary of the UN said that if the goal of the invasion was to effect regime change (which Bush had said it was) then it was contrary to the UN Charter. 

Given the dubiousness of the war’s justification and the lack of UN approval for military action, it was the view of many legal experts at the time - and since then - that the war should be legally considered a war of aggression and therefore a crime. Then there are the war crimes and abuses committed during the invasion and occupation, which I have neither the space nor the tactfulness to adequately discuss here and I hope some of our flared users might be able to offer their expertise. 

Which brings me onto a reminder of some of our rules. Given some of the trepidation we have about the Iraq War being open to questions, we want to make some things clear. Firstly, it’s only 2003 that has become open to questions, so if your questions spill over into 2004, we’re going to delete them. Try to keep Iraq War questions to the initial invasion and first few months of occupation. Secondly, we have rules about soapboxing and loaded comments in both [questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glq47z/rules_roundtable_xiii_soapboxing_loaded_questions/) and [answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/glq5f8/rules_roundtable_xiv_political_agendas_moralizing/). While there is no such thing as an unbiased answer, there is such a thing as an answer or question that is clearly pushing an agenda at the expense of the facts, and we don’t like those. If you’re one of the millions of British people who want Tony Blair to be tried as a war criminal, that’s cool but don’t go on about it here. If you despise Saddam Hussein, that’s fine but post about it elsewhere. If you like Dick Cheney, you’re allowed to have that opinion but don’t bring it to our comments. If you want to ask “How was the 2003 invasion of Iraq viewed under international law at the time?” that’s a fair question, but if you want to ask “Why is George Bush a war criminal?”, then that is a leading question and we will delete it. 

Finally, we recognise that some of our readers, and potential contributors, fought in the Iraq War or know someone who did. Please keep in mind that we have a rule regarding anecdotal evidence, not because first hand accounts don’t have value (they certainly do!) but because of the reasons we set out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj1kw7/rules_roundtable_vii_no_personal_anecdotes/). 

That concludes our summary of some of the things that are now available for questions. See you again in 2004 when you get to ask about the return of the Summer Olympics to Athens and a new tech thing called “The Facebook”.",AskHistorians

So in our internal discussions, input from our flaired community, and the clear consensus of the user base expressed in the vote, the determination is neither to black out entirely (which was a distant second place in votes), nor to reopen entirely (which was barely an afterthought in the vote tallies). We will remain open, but in a limited capacity. We will not be allowing user submissions, but will be having periodic Floating Features on various topics. We’ll be kicking it off tomorrow with the history of John/Oliver, welcoming users to share historical content that relates to the history of people named John (Juan/Ivan/Joanna/etc.) or Oliver (Olivia/Oliviero/etc.).

We know folks have questions so will address some of them here:

**Do the threats of removal from Reddit concern you?**

Both yes and no. Reddit has been forcing communities to reopen the past few days, under threat of removing members of the mod team. This has included other subreddits that share moderators with AskHistorians. We have not received such a threat *yet—*, since it seems as though affected subreddits are those that completely blacked out. However, should they target subreddits operating under certain restrictions we may be targeted. We have several thoughts on this:

* First… not to toot our own horn, but we are not an easy mod team to replace, and doing so would result in the destruction of this subreddit. The amount of time and effort that the mod team puts in—not to mention the level of knowledge expertise—is *not replicable*. We expect the Admins know this, and recognize that we *do* hold more leverage than the average subreddit. Reddit has [used AskHistorians as a subreddit to highlight for what we do](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.redditinc.com/blog/r-askhistorians-community-hosts-first-ever-virtual-conference-on-reddit), often to contrast with more unsavory parts of the site. Although Reddit is *far* from immune to hypocrisy, to directly attack our mod team would be a far bigger PR headache than, say, [going after r/piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/14briu5/hey_rpiracy_reddit_admins_demodded_the_captain/), would be.

* Second, [Reddit has framed removing mod teams as being about “the community”](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/14b5q1f/how_to_request_an_abandoned_community_or_a_mod/). We have been as clear as possible that all of our actions over the past week have been with the [community in mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/146xzgk/meta_tomorrow_askhistorians_will_go_private/). We have also [tried to be as transparent as possible to keep the community informed](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1495wpj/askhistorians_is_back_up_but_currently_restricted/) about what actions we are taking, why we are doing so, and how they impact the community. Recently, we were part of polling initiated by Reddit to gauge satisfaction with the mod team and *we* know that *Reddit* knows [we have a 91.88% satisfaction rating, which is nearly 20% higher than average for subreddits of similar size](https://i.ibb.co/zPtwkVG/Screen-Shot-2023-06-18-at-9-16-40-PM.png). In the current situation, we have seen *overwhelming* support for our current course of action both from the users and in consultation specifically with the flared members of the community, so we can confidently say that we are acting in accordance with the letter of the law that the Admins have laid down, including with our recent polling that was [carefully](https://i.ibb.co/0mgv0Lt/Votes-at-1100.png) [monitored](https://i.ibb.co/PzKnk2F/Votes-at-1400.png) [for](https://i.ibb.co/W2vHRSZ/Votes-at-1800.png) [brigading](https://i.ibb.co/KWPNqmv/Votes-at-2000.png). Our path forward is [in line](https://i.ibb.co/44pDGf8/0600-Votes.jpg) with [what our polling of the community supports](https://i.ibb.co/M5cy2mS/0800-votes.png).

* Finally, while none of that is *guaranteed* to protect us, part of our decision here to not *fully* reopen is specifically to assert our right as mods to guide the community. It has been an explicit promise of Reddit that that right is vested in the moderators. We have invested a decade of our collective time—and for many of us nearly as much as individuals—building and curating this community based on that promise. Even if we might be safer than some teams, **we are advocating not just for us, but for other teams as well**. In mod back-channels, morale is beyond low, and the threat that this poses to Reddit *as a whole* is incalculable. We know that we cannot rely on those past promises, but that doesn’t stop us from asserting the moral high ground here, and ringing the bell of shame at the Admins.

**What will see you reopen fully?**

The original impetus for the blacking out of subreddits was spurred on by uncertainties around API changes. While we would be thrilled to see Reddit finally change course and implement a new pricing structure that allows third-party apps to continue to function and not be priced out of existence, we are, and have always been, open to compromise. As noted in previous communications, we have seen promises made by Reddit regarding several of the sticking points, and the back-channel discussions have often been productive. We expect Pushshift functionality—and the search functionality built off of it—to return. We also have seen a mod tools roadmap that is intended to bring significant increased functionality to the official Mobile App. And Reddit has also made promises about improvements for accessibility on its own app, and has said that it is working to allow several non-profit accessibility apps to function under the new API scheme. We will be keeping a close eye on how and when these are all achieved. Promises were made by Reddit, and if we see them meeting those promises, they will factor into our periodic reevaluations, [similar to the approach from r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/14axtmu/rscience_is_restricted_until_monday/).

However other promises have also been made by Reddit in the past, and recent developments have shaken our broader faith in Reddit to the core. The actions taken by Reddit against mod teams, including threats to reopen and removing team members who have refused, have created turmoil, distrust, and instability on this site like never seen before. The devaluing of the unpaid volunteers who have played a critical role in making Reddit what it is simply *cannot* be ignored. We rely on moderators having considerable flexibility in how we run our communities in order to do what we do here. 

In communications previously, we stated that we didn’t see this as the end of AskHistorians on Reddit… and while we aren’t prepared to say that yet, the completion of this shift would potentially change that evaluation. For now, the site Admin has not made a clear statement on what recent actions mean, and [we only have the very concerning comments from Spez](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-protest-blackout-ceo-steve-huffman-moderators-rcna89544), and [the piecemeal reports from mod teams being threatened or actioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/egg_irl/comments/14cor4v/starting_today_and_until_reddit_relents_on_their/). Once—or if—more expansive statements are forthcoming, we will be able to better evaluate them, and also better evaluate what they mean not just for the future of AskHistorians, but the future of Reddit as a whole, and decide on next steps from there.

Finally, we are not doing a one-and-done polling of the community. As we have said time and again, while we may rule AskHistorians with an iron fist, we always act in what we see as best for the community, and best to maintain our mission and standards. While that does not inherently mean doing what is popular—a core principle of the subreddit after all is that upvotes don’t mean an answer is actually good—we care deeply about how you are all feeling, and will commit to periodic check-in threads.

As in the past, no one, single factor makes or breaks whether we fully reopen or not, or black-out again or not. They all inform our decisions, and we continue to monitor them as things evolve. That said, we don’t expect to *fully* reopen before the end of the month. 

**So what are you doing for now, and why?**

Our decision, and the choice of the community as well, is a limited opening. Users will not be able to submit questions. We will be posting Floating Features every day or two around a variety of themes. Floating Features are intended to be narrow on one axis, but incredibly broad on the other, to allow for a very wide variety of submissions from many times and places. The opening feature, which will go up tomorrow morning, [follows the lead of many subreddits](https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/reddit-protests-john-oliver-pics.html), being about the history of John/Oliver, inviting historical submissions about people by those names or derivations of it.

*Many* subreddits, faced with the threats by the site Admins, have chosen a route which is best described as some sort of malicious compliance, reopening, but not in the same way they were before. While our implementation might feel rather muted in comparison to, say, /r/interestingasfuck’s [decision to remove all non-site wide rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/14c0vcf/rinterestingasfuck_will_be_reopening_monday_june/), we do nevertheless see it in a similar vein. Reddit has demonstrated their disrespect for mod teams, for the work that they do, the passion that they bring, and the tools that they need. Running AskHistorians under normal circumstances takes a *massive* amount of effort, while doing one feature per day allows us to keep our community open, keep it generating *some* content, but at a level of activity commensurate with the respect that Reddit seems to give to that work.

We recognize that there are cons. More critically, we are still *allowing our content to be seen*, and we’re still allowing *some* new content to be generated, and with it some ad revenue. Our hope is that in doing so it is balanced out by how that content is framed, with Floating Features all opening up with reminders about what is happening… and many of those Features likely being done as (not so) subtle commentary on the goings on.

**OK, so *now* are you leaving Reddit?**

As was buried up there somewhere… we *don’t* like potential pictures of the future. We still want to be here. We still want Reddit to be our home. We want the Admins to show reason why both sides can de-escalate and course correct to save that future. We really hope that will happen. For now? Bookmark www.askhistorians.com.

Correct me if I am wrong, but in Sunni Islam, the Caliph is a head of state who is recognised by other Sunni nations as the leader of their faith, and their nation becomes known as a [Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate).

The Ottoman Empire became a Caliphate in 1517 upon their conquest of [Hejaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz), a region encompassing the Two Holy Cities of Islam, [Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca) and [Medina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina). They continued to use the title of Caliph until [Atatürk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk) [abolished the institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_the_Caliphate) in 1924. The Mamluks, who the Ottomans captured Hejaz from, was the overlord to [the previous caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate) from 1261-1517.

As the Ottoman Empire was collapsing, in 1916, the Two Holy Cities broke away from Ottoman Rule, entering under the rule of [Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hejaz), who capitalised on this to [claim the title of caliph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharifian_Caliphate). Then, in 1925, the Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz was conquered by [Ibn Saud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud), who later united the kingdoms of al-Hasa, Qatif, Nejd and the Hejaz into [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia) in 1932.

The House of Saud never claimed the title of Caliph, even after conquering Hejaz. Considering the contexts, I don't understand why:

* Previous Sunni Muslim rulers of Hejaz claimed the title of Sunni Caliph.
* Proclaiming themselves as Caliphs would allow Saudi Arabia to further increase their legitimacy and reputation among the Muslim world.
* Saudi Arabia is a theocratic absolute monarchy, adhering to the extremely conservative [Wahhabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabi) form of Sunni Islam, without any pretenses of secularism.
* Another Wahhabi group, the [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant), does claim the title of Caliph (but no nation ever recognised their claim), even though they have a far weaker claim (i.e. they don't own Hejaz).
* The phenomenon of [Petro-Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro-Islam) refers to Saudi Arabia promoting Wahhabism around the world, and having a sizable international influence, due to its oil wealth. With so much wealth and influence, Saudi Arabia seems like they can get more international recognition of a claim to the Caliphate than the Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz did.",AskHistorians

The traveler would hang their hat on the door indicating that they are still there so the husband wouldn't return.

Last year, there was an obvious new topic that was suddenly available for discussion: 9/11. As a result, last year’s post was almost exclusively a brief summary of the historical events surrounding that. Mercifully, 2002 was a relatively quiet year for most of the world. Rather than expecting to get several questions a month on 9/11, this year we’re expecting maybe two questions all year going “huh, Switzerland joined the UN in 2002, why did that happen?” So rather than tackling a big topic, this post is going to go through some of the events that are now available for questions. Think of it more as a trip down memory lane, where we can once again remind ourselves that 20 years ago was not the 1990s, but the early 2000s, and that we are therefore getting old and further out of touch with the youth of today. 

**2002 - The Year of Tedious but Kind of Important Diplomatic and Legislative Stuff**

Looking through the significant events of 2002, there is no massive event that seized the attention of the whole world. Instead, we find a lot of diplomatic or legislative initiatives that may have seemed tedious or uninteresting at the time for most people, but have gone on to have some significant impact around the globe. On the low end of that spectrum, there’s Switzerland joining the UN. It was the first country to join the UN via referendum (held 6 six months earlier in 2001), which overturned a 1986 referendum that went against UN membership by a three to one margin. According to their government, the Swiss considered the risk of being dragged into the Cold War by joining the UN was too great in 1986, but with that conflict many years behind them as of the 2001 referendum, the Swiss were ready to sign up. 

Elsewhere in Europe, it was launch day for one of the EU’s flagship initiatives. On 1 January 2002, the Euro began to be issued as legal tender across the 12 EU countries that had chosen to adopt it. This massive change of currency was intended to make it easier for Europeans and foreign businesses to trade, as having to deal with a dozen currencies at once when doing business in the EU was something of a bother. The issuing of a pan-European currency had been discussed for decades, and the currency had technically launched in 1999 in preparation for the proper rollout. But for the first time you could walk into a cafe and buy a croissant with coins bearing the €. There were concerns about the stability of a currency being adopted by 12 different economies at once, and there were worries about inflation from throwing all this new money around, but by the end of 2002 the Euro had settled in and climbed in value from $0.82 in January to over $1 in December and things seemed to have gone pretty smoothly, even if the banknotes felt a bit like handling Monopoly money. 

Two other major international initiatives also got going in 2002. In May, the African Union was launched. It aimed to fix the problems of the Organisation of African Unity that it was replacing. In July, the International Criminal Court was established with The Hague as its headquarters. 

Moving east, it was a rough year in relations between the Koreas. As the 2002 FIFA World Cup was being held in South Korea, the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong was fought between two North Korean patrol boats and six South Korean vessels, resulting in one ship sunk and at least 19 men dead, 43 men wounded. In better news from eastern Asia, the nation of East Timor gained its full independence in April and joined the UN in September.  

In Africa, the long running Angolan Civil War ended following over 20 years of violence. The conflict displaced around a third of Angola’s population and had involved several other peoples and nations including the Soviet Union, South Africa, Zambia, Namibia, Democratic Republic of the Congo (known as Zaire for much of the conflict), and Cuba. Although the war left Angola in a dire state that it still struggles to recover from today, at least the fighting itself was coming to a close. 

In the US, 2002 was a relatively quiet year compared to those before or since. Perhaps it would be easier to cover some of the cultural juggernauts that our predominantly American audience may remember. *American Idol* launched, propelling Kelly Clarkson to fame. The *Ice Age* franchise began with its first film. Sand haters everywhere were pleased to see some representation in *Star Wars: Episode 2: Attack of the Clones*. Nickelback ruled the charts. *Men in Black II* was… also a thing. *The Simpsons* was already up to Season 14. In my own United Kingdom, we got a new James Bond film in the form of *Die Another Day*, starring John Cleese as Q, so perhaps 2002 was not the best year in popular culture. However, there were some decent successes as the modern blockbuster film took shape, with *Spider-Man* showing that superhero films could be serious hits, and *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* released in December. In more serious and consequential news for the US, the Homeland Security Act was signed into law, and the No Child Left Behind Act was implemented, aiming to transform American security and education respectively. 

Toward the end of the year, there were some disturbing omens of what was to come, and it was clear that 2003 was not shaping up to be a good one. In November, the medical community in Guangdong province, China, noted that many of its patients had a disease similar in symptoms to flu that killed around 1 in 10 of its victims. It turned out to be the result of SARS-CoV-1, a coronavirus which had jumped from a bat colony to humans. Although beginning in November, the outbreak was not taken seriously until March the following year. I suspect if it wasn’t for the sequel to SARS-CoV-1, there wouldn’t be much interest in the SARS epidemic. However, our interest in the past is overwhelmingly shaped by current events - just look back on how many questions on Afghanistan we got in September/August 2021 - so it’s worth mentioning here. But keep in mind that most questions about the SARS outbreak and whether we did or didn’t learn important lessons will actually pertain to 2003-4, or even 2019-20, so we moderators get to relax for at least another year on most of the SARS content. 

And of course, there were signs of a major confrontation brewing between Iraq and the United States as Resolution 1441 was debated in the UN. There was growing concern over the weapons programmes of Saddam Hussein’s regime, but there were doubts regarding both the validity of those concerns and the right response to take in the face of rearmament by Saddam Hussein. The US began to build up its military in the region, Iraq did likewise, and on December 23 a US drone was shot down by an Iraqi fighter jet. This was both the first recorded combat engagement between a drone and a manned aircraft, and a significant escalation in the diplomatic crisis. But like the SARS epidemic, most questions on the Iraq War will actually pertain to 2003 onwards, so please keep questions about it strictly on the pre-war diplomatic crisis. 

See you next year, when you finally get to ask a million questions about Iraq and whether [insert politician here] is really a war criminal, despite all the other interesting things that happened in 2003.",AskHistorians

By saying ""africans were complicit in the slave trade"" i'm only looking at objective facts, not an analysis of the power relationships that led to that complicity, or anything like that, which obviously complicates the issue.

523,1625752534.0,"Weimar Germany had laws against hate speech, closed down hundreds of Nazi papers, jailed Goebbels for antisemitism, and even banned Hitler from speaking. However, Nazi ideology still spread, and the Nazis still rose to power. Why did this happen? Does this mean hate speech laws are ineffective?","Much of what I said can be found in this [post](https://www.thefire.org/eric-berkowitzs-new-book-dangerous-ideas-is-a-masterpiece-but-i-have-some-quibbles/) by Greg Lukianoff, a co-author of the book The Coddling of the American Mind. 

In this article, seems that Lukianoff is using this incident - which he called ""Weimar fallacy"" - as evidence against the notion that restrictions on speech could prevent atrocities. To explain why this happened, Lukianoff claimed that the Nazis actually capitalized on this restriction as a means to propagate their ideas. 

I find this argument somewhat suspicious. First, I don't see the term ""Weimar fallacy"" being used very often [among academic circles](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=%E2%80%9CWeimar+Fallacy%E2%80%9D&btnG=), contrary to what Lukianoff suggested in this piece. Furthermore, his conclusions also go against recent studies which show that the supposed [martyring of those censored by free speech laws are effectively non-existent](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:366584/UQ366584_OA.pdf), which nullifies his reasoning as to why the Nazis gained power despite all the restrictions. 

This leads me to my questions, which I will elaborate more here. I would like to ask: 

1. Did the Nazis actually benefit from the speech restrictions, as claimed by Lukianoff, or was their ascent aided by something else entirely? 

2. Can this incident be reliably used as a warning against hate speech laws (which Lukianoff is apparently doing), or is the ""Weimar fallacy"" only an exception to the rule?

I acknowledge that the second question may not be entirely relevant to history, but I feel that a lot of people share this concern upon reading this article, so I think it is best to address it beforehand.

The subject of Black Confederates is one of the most misunderstood topics in American history.

Here's the book blurb:

More than 150 years after the end of the Civil War, scores of websites,  articles, and organizations repeat claims that anywhere between 500 and  100,000 free and enslaved African Americans fought willingly as soldiers  in the Confederate army. But as Kevin M. Levin argues in this carefully  researched book, such claims would have shocked anyone who served in  the army during the war itself. Levin explains that imprecise  contemporary accounts, poorly understood primary-source material, and  other misrepresentations helped fuel the rise of the black Confederate  myth. Moreover, Levin shows that belief in the existence of black  Confederate soldiers largely originated in the 1970s, a period that  witnessed both a significant shift in how Americans remembered the Civil  War and a rising backlash against African Americans’ gains in civil  rights and other realms.

Levin also investigates the roles that  African Americans actually performed in the Confederate army, including  personal body servants and forced laborers. He demonstrates that  regardless of the dangers these men faced in camp, on the march, and on  the battlefield, their legal status remained unchanged. Even long after  the guns fell silent, Confederate veterans and other writers remembered  these men as former slaves and not as soldiers, an important reminder  that how the war is remembered often runs counter to history.

##**Summary of The Recent Announcement** 

On May 27, 2021 the chief of the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation in British Columbia, Rosanne Casimir, announced the discovery of the remains of 215 children in a mass grave on the grounds of the Kamloops Indian Residential School. The mass grave, containing children as young as three years old, was discovered through use of ground penetrating radar. According to Casimir, the school left behind no record of these burials. Subsequent recovery efforts will help determine the chronology of interment, as well as aid identification of these students ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57291530)).

For Indigenous peoples across the United States and Canada, the discovery of this mass grave opened anew the deep intergenerational wounds created by the respective boarding/residential school systems implemented in each colonizing nation. For decades survivors, and the families of those who did not survive, have advocated for investigation and restitution. They’ve proposed national movements and worked tirelessly to force national and international awareness of a genocidal past that included [similar mass graves](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2016/1/3/unmarked-graves-discovered-at-chemawa-indian-school) of Indigenous children [across North America](https://www.indianz.com/News/2018/08/13/us-army-looking-for-families-of-children.asp). Acknowledgment and reckoning in the United States and Canada has been slow. 

As more information emerges over the coming weeks and months, Kamloops school survivors, their descendents, historians, and archaeologists will piece together the lives and experiences of these 215 children. Here we provide a brief introduction to the industrial/boarding/residential schools, and how similar children navigated their experiences in a deeply oppressive system. The violence enacted on these children was the continuation of a failed conquest that began centuries ago and manifests today with the disproportionate rates of Missing and Murdered Indigenous People, especially women.

##**Overview of Indian Boarding/Residential School Systems**

Catholic missions during the 16th and 17th centuries routinely used forced child labor for construction and building maintenance. Missionaries saw “civilizing” Indigenous children as part of their spiritual responsibility and one of the first statutes related to education in the British colonies in North America was guidance to colonizers on how to correctly “educate Indian Children Held Hostage” (Fraser, p. 4). While the first US government-operated Indian Boarding Schools didn’t open until 1879, the federal government endorsed these religiously led efforts through the passage of legislation prior to assuming full administrative jurisdiction, beginning with the “Civilization Fund Act” of 1819, [an annual allotment of monies to be utilized by groups who would provide educational services to Tribes who were in contact with white settlements.](https://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=3&page=516#)

The creation of the systems in both countries was predicated on the belief among white adults that there was something wrong or “savage” with the Indigenous way of being and by “educating” children, they could most effectively advance and save Indigenous people. By the time the schools began enrolling children in the mid to late-1800s, the Indigenous people and nations of North America had experienced centuries of displacement, broken or ignored treaties, and genocide. Understanding this history helps contextualize why it’s possible to read anecdotes about Indigenous parents voluntarily sending their children to the schools or why many abolitionists in the United States supported the schools. No matter the reason why a child ended up at a school, they were typically miles from their community and home, placed there by adults. Regardless of the length of their experience at a school, their sense of Indigeneity was forever altered. 

It is impossible to know the exact number of children who left, or were taken from, their homes and communities for places known collectively as Indian Boarding Schools, Aboriginal Residential schools, or Indian Residential Schools. Upwards of 600 schools were opened across the continent, often deliberately in places far from reservations or Indigenous communities. Sources put the number of children who were enrolled at the schools in Canada at around [150,000](http://www.anishinabek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/An-Overview-of-the-IRS-System-Booklet.pdf). It’s important to stress that these schools were not schools in the way we think of them in the modern era. There were no bright colors, read-alouds and storytime, or opportunities for play. As we explain below, though, this does not mean the children did not find joy and community. The primary focus was not necessarily a child’s intellect, but more their body and, especially at the schools run by members of a church, their soul. The teachers’ pedagogical goals were about “civilizing” Indigenous children; they used whatever means necessary to break the children’s connection with their community, to their identity, and from their culture, including corporal punishment and food deprivation. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8zgozt/monday_methods_the_main_purpose_of_educating_them/) from u/Snapshot52 provides a longer history about the rationale for the “schools.” 

One of the main goals of the schools can be seen in their name. While the children who were enrolled at the schools came from hundreds of different tribes - the Thomas Asylum of Orphan and Destitute Indian Children in Western New York enrolled Haudenosaunee children, including from those from the nearby Mohawk and Seneca communities as well as children from other Indigenous communities across the east coast (Burich, 2007) - they were all referred to as “Indians'', despite their different identities, languages, and cultural traditions. (The r/IndianCountry [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/wiki/faq)  provides more information about nomenclature and Indigenous identity.) Meanwhile, only 20% of children were actually orphans; most of the children had living relatives and communities who could and often wanted to care for them. 

##**Similarities between Canadian and American system and schools**

>When I went East to Carlisle School, I thought I was going there to die;... I could think of white people wanting little Lakota children for no other reason than to kill them, but I thought here is my chance to prove that I can die bravely. So I went East to show my father and my people that I was brave and willing to die for them. (Óta Kté/Plenty Kill/Luther Standing Bear)

The founder of the United States residential/boarding school model, and superintendent of the flagship school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Richard Henry Pratt, wished for a certain kind of death from his students. Pratt believed by forcing Indigenous children to “kill the Indian/savage” within them they might live as equal citizens in a progressive civilized nation. To this end, students were stripped of reminders of their former life. Arrival at school meant the destruction of clothes lovingly made by their family and donning starched, uncomfortable uniforms and stiff boots. Since Indigenous names were too complex for white ears and tongues, students chose, or were assigned, Anglicized names. Indigenous languages were forbidden, and “speaking Indian” resulted in harsh corporal punishments. Scholars such as Eve Haque and Shelbi Nahwilet Meissner use the term “linguicide” to describe deliberate efforts to bring about the death of a language and they point to the efforts of the schools to accomplish that goal. 

Perhaps nothing was as initially traumatic for new students as mandatory haircuts, nominally done to prevent lice, but interpreted by students as being marked by “civilization.” This subtle but culturally destructive act would elicit grieving and an experience of emotional torture as the cutting of one’s hair was, and is, often regarded as an act of mourning for many Indigenous communities reserved for the death of a close family member. This resulted in psychological turmoil for a number of children who had no way of knowing the fate of the families they were being forced to leave behind. By removing children from their nations and families, residential schools intentionally prevented the transmission of traditional cultural knowledge and language. The original hope of school administrators was to thereby kill Indigeneity in one generation. 

**In this they failed.** 

Over time, the methods and intent of the schools changed, focusing instead on making Indigenous children “useful” citizens in a modernizing nation. In addition to the traditional school topics like reading and writing students at residential schools engaged in skill classes like animal husbandry, tinsmithing, harness making, and sewing. They labored in the school fields, harvesting their own food, though students reported the choicest portions somehow ended up on the teachers' plates, and never their own. Girls worked in the damp school laundry, or scrubbed dishes and floors after class. The rigors of school work, combined with the manual labor that allowed schools to function, left children exhausted. Survivors report pervasive physical and sexual abuse during their years at school.

Epidemics of infectious diseases like influenza and measles routinely swept through the cramped, poorly ventilated quarters of residential school dorms. Children already weakened by insufficient rations, forced labor, and the cumulative psychosocial stress of the residential school experience quickly succumbed to pathogens. The most fatal was tuberculosis, historically called consumption. The superintendent of Crow Creek, South Dakota reported practically all his pupils “seemed to be tainted with scrofula and consumption” (Adams, p.130). 

On the Nez Perce reservation in Idaho in 1908, Indian Agent Oscar H. Lipps and agency physician John N. Alley conspired to close the boarding school at Fort Lapwai so they could open a sanitarium school, a facility that would provide medical services to the high rates of tubercular Indian children “while simultaneously attending to the educational goals consistent with the assimilation campaign” (James, 2011, p. 152).

Indeed, the high fatality rates at residential/boarding schools became a source of hidden shame for superintendents like Pratt at Carlisle. Of the forty students comprising the first classes at Carlisle ten died in the first three years, either at school or shortly after returning home. Mortality rates were so high, and superintendents so concerned about their statistics, schools began shipping sick children home to die, and officially reported only those deaths that occured on school grounds (Adams p.130). 

>When a pupil begins to have hemorrhages from the lungs he or she knows, and all the rest know, just what they mean... And such incidents keep occurring, at intervals, throughout every year. Not many pupils die at school. They prefer not to do so; and the last wishes of themselves and their parents are not disregarded. But they go home and die… Four have done so this year. (Annual Report to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Crow Creek, 1897)

Often superintendents placed blame on the Indigenous families, citing the student’s poor health on arrival, instead of the unhealthy conditions surrounding them at school. At Carlisle, the flagship residential/boarding school for the United States and the site of the greatest governmental oversight in the nation, the school cemetery contains 192 graves. Thirteen headstones are engraved with one word: *Unknown*.

##**Specifics about the Canadian system**
>We instil in them a pronounced distaste for the native life so that they will be humiliated when reminded of their origins. When they graduate from our institutions, the children have lost everything Native except their blood. (Quote attributed Bishop Vital-Justin Grandin, early advocate of the Canadian Residential School System)

A summary [report](http://www.anishinabek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/An-Overview-of-the-IRS-System-Booklet.pdf) created by the Union of Ontario Indians based on the work and findings of the [Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada](http://www.trc.ca/assets/pdf/Volume_4_Missing_Children_English_Web.pdf) lays out a number of specifics including that the schools in Canada were predominately funded and operated by the Government of Canada and Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian and United churches. Changes to the Indian Act in the 1920s make it mandatory for every Indian child between the ages of seven and sixteen years to attend such schools and in 1933, the principals of the schools were given legal guardianship of the children the schools, effectively forcing parents to give up legal custody of their children.

A good resource for learning more about the history of the schools is the Commission’s [website](https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1450124405592/1529106060525).

##**Specifics about the American system**

The American system was intended to further both the imperial and humanitarian aspects of the forming hegemony. While Indians were often in the path of conquest, elements of the American public felt that there was a need to “civilize” the Tribes in order to bring them closer to society and to salvation. With this in mind, education was deemed the modality by which this could happen: the destruction of a cultural identity that bred opposition to Manifest Destiny with the simultaneous construction of an ideal (though still minoritized) member of society.

It is not a coincidence that many of the methods the white adults used at the Indian Boarding Schools bore a similarity to those methods used by enslavers in the American South. Children from the same tribe or community were often separated from each other to ensure they couldn’t communicate in any language other than English. While there are anecdotes of children choosing their own English or white name, most children were assigned a name, some by simply pointing to a list of indecipherable scribbles (potential names) written on a chalkboard (Luther Standing Bear). Carlisle in particular was seen as the best case scenario and often treated as a showcase of what was possible around “civilizing” Indigenous children. Rather than killing off Indigenous people, Pratt and other superintendents saw their solution of re-education as a more viable, more Christian, approach to the “Indian Problem.”

##**Resistance and Restitution**
As with investigations of similar oppressive systems (African slavery in the American South, neophytes in North American Spanish missions, etc.), understanding how children in residential/boarding schools navigated a genocidal environment must avoid interpreting every act as a reaction or response to authority. Instead, stories from survivors help us see students as active agents, pursuing their own goals, in their own time frames, as often as they could. Meanwhile, some graduates of the schools would speak about the pleasure they found in learning about European literature, science, or music and would go to make a life for themselves that included knowledge they gained at the school. Such anecdotes are not evidence that the schools ""worked"" or were necessary, rather they serve as an example of the graduates' agency and self-determination.

Surviving captivity meant selectively accommodating and resisting, sometimes moment to moment, throughout the day. The most common form of resistance was running away. Runaways occurred so often Carlisle didn’t bother reporting missing students unless they were absent for more than a week. One survivor reported her young classmates climbed into the same bed each night so, together, they could fight off the regular sexual assault by a male teacher. At school children found hidden moments to feel human; telling Coyote Stories or “speaking Indian” to each other after lights out, conducting midnight raids on the school kitchen, or leaving school grounds to meet up with a romantic partner. Sports, particularly boxing, basketball, and football, became ways to “show what an Indian can do” on a level playing field against white teams from the surrounding area. Resistance often took a darker turn, and the threat of arson was used by students in multiple schools to push back against unreasonable demands. Groups of Indigenous girls at a school in Quebec reportedly made life difficult for the nuns who ran the school, resulting in a high staff turnover. At a fundraiser, one sister proclaimed:
> de cent de celles qui ont passé par nos mains à peine en avons nous civilisé une” [of a hundred of those who have passed through our hands we have civilized at most one]. 

Graduates and students used the English/French language writing skills obtained at the schools to raise awareness of school conditions. They regularly petitioned the government, local authorities, and the surrounding community for assistance. Gus Welch, star quarterback for the Carlisle Indians football team, collected 273 student signatures for a petition to investigate corruption at Carlisle. Welch testified before the 1914 joint congressional committee that resulted in the firing of the school superintendent, the abusive bandmaster/disciplinarian, and the football coach. Carlisle closed its doors several years later. The investigation into Carlisle would form the basis for the Meriam Report, which highlighted the damage inflicted by the residential schools throughout the United States. 

While most of the schools closed before World War II, several stayed open and continued to enroll Indigenous children with the intention of providing them a Canadian or American education well into the 1970s. The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 changed policies related to Tribal and family involvement in child welfare cases but the work continues. [These boarding schools have survived even into more recent times through rebranding efforts under the Bureau of Indian Education.](https://chemawa.bie.edu/history.html) The “Not Your Mascot” movement and efforts to end the [harmful use](https://www.ncai.org/proudtobe) of Native or Indigenous imagery by the education systems can also be seen as a continued fight for sovereignty and self-determination.

##**The Modern Murdered and Missing Indigenous People Movement**
Today, Indigenous peoples in the United States and Canada confront the familiar specter of national ambivalence in the face of disproportionate violence. In the United States, Indigenous women are murdered at ten times the rate of other ethnicities, while in Canada Indigenous women are murdered at a rate six times higher than their white neighbors. This burden is not equally distributed across the country; in the provinces of Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan the murder rates are even higher. While the movement began with a focus on missing and murdered Indigenous women, awareness campaigns expanded to include Two-Spirit individuals as well as men. 

The residential boarding schools exist within the greater context of an unfinished work of conquest. The legacy of violence stretches from the swamps of the Mystic Massacre in 1637 to the fields of Sand Creek to the newly discovered mass grave at Kamloops Indian Residential School. By waging war on Indigenous children, authorities hope to extinguish Indigeneity on the continent. When they failed violence continued anew, morphing into specific violence against vulnerable Indigenous People. Citizens of Canada and the United States must wrestle with the violent legacy as we, together, move forward in understanding and reconciliation.

Why is it that for like thousands of years every sculptor used smooth Barbie anatomy on female forms while spending months perfectly chiseling a penis on male forms?,"I’m looking into buying a block of marble and attempting to make a legitimate classical sculpture spoof.  I’ve more on less settled on doing a female form and have been spending a good amount of time looking at classical and renaissance and modern statues for ideas and references and whatever.  One thing I’ve always wondered about since visiting Rome as a teenager, and have been thinking about a lot recently, is what exactly caused the almost uniform decision across time and cultures to basically never attempt to carve female genitalia and just always give them the ol smooth Barbie crotch?

Did any Greek or Roman artists whose work survived ever experiment with actually carving a vagina and/or female pubic hair like they all did with penises, or was that just entirely off limits?  Could there have been other, more lewd and anatomically correct statues that weren’t as valuable or well preserved in important places or were later destroyed by zealots or looters and are just lost to history?   Is it possible that some of the Greek statues may have originally been more realistic and had been later carved down to Barbie form later? 

Even in the Renaissance, would a nude sculpture of a woman with pubic hair or evidence of a vagina have been a scandal?  Would the patrons just reject it and make them sand it down?",AskHistorians

547,1626507954.0,How can I prove to my girlfriend’s dad the Holocaust existed?,"I am currently on vacation with my girlfriend’s family and her dad has always been a bit extreme. For stories sake I will call him Bill. Bill is very intelligent and spends most of his time studying history in the Middle East. 

Tonight we checked into a new Airbnb and I found a stack of DVDs in the room I am staying in (sadly I have the pullout in the living room.) To wind down I put on the first DVD of a 6 part WWII documentary. Roughly 15 minutes in, Bill insists that I need to turn it off as it’s all American propaganda to pity Jews and to despise the German people. Bill quickly changes his mind and starts using it as a tool to teach me what really happened in WWII… 

Fast forward 2 hours of me being stuck in a room being lectured by Bill.

According to Bill’s own research, America joined WWI because of the Balfour Declaration and the Jews claimed that they would be able to persuade the Americans to join the war if Britain promised them Palestine. Somewhere down the road the Jews were given Palestine and were partnered with the German democrats who agreed to the treaty of Versailles. Thus the difficulties and poverty in Germany following WWI was ultimately the Jews fault.

Bill believes that the Jews were forced out of Germany during this time period leading up to WWII and flooded Turkey and the Middle East. Jews who remained worked in factories for the war. 

Bill believes that footage we have of concentration camps were Hollywood’s attempt to rally American troops towards the war efforts and were staged. The bodies of skeletons were those who suffered of typhoid fever or of homosexuals who were disposed of (who are equally as manipulative as the Jews.) Numbers and tattoos on the bodies were for sick count to research and study typhoid. 

Bill also believes that testimonies aren’t usually factual and were paid off. What historical evidence do we have that is irrefutable and can help me properly keep my sanity? Sources and documents (preferably from German record during the time period) would be greatly appreciated.",AskHistorians

What are YOU doing from September 15-17? **Because AskHistorians is hosting an academic conference – and we want you to be there!**

From the American Historical Association to the National Council on Public History, AskHistorians is no stranger to the conference scene. But this September, the tables will be turned: we’re inviting historians from across the world to take part in the inaugural AskHistorians Digital Conference!

You can expect video presentations and discussions featuring some of your favourite regular posters alongside experts and professional historians, accompanied by AMAs, special events and a keynote by Dr Alex Wellerstein (our very own u/restricteddata). The papers will be recorded, closed-captioned, and not pay-walled – it’s an academic conference, but for everyone!

This is a huge new step for AskHistorians. Due to Covid-19, quarantine, and social-distancing rules, in-person gatherings like academic conferences have been cancelled or moved online. Amidst these disruptions, we realized that /r/AskHistorians has something unique to offer: a whole digital platform already dedicated to sharing historical knowledge… with one of the largest and best-informed groups of history fans in the world! Our community is a natural home for historians to share their research and ideas online in these strange circumstances.

The conference theme reflects this: “‘Business as *Un*usual: Histories of Rupture, Chaos, Revolution, and Change’”. This event and the times we live in are unusual – but then so are many of the lives, events and phenomena historians study. While relatively few world events have been as disruptive as those that have unfolded this year, human history is full of examples of people attempting to make do under difficult, changing circumstances. We hope to be able to share histories that are insightful, fascinating and help us all reflect on what we’re going through.

Rather than simply trying to adapt a traditional academic conference into a new kind of digital space, we are hoping to really push the boundaries of what a conference can achieve. Our mission has always been about breaking down the artificial barriers that exist between those who produce historical knowledge, and those who want to learn more about the past. Above all, we hope that by offering a window into how historians of all types go about their craft, we will help open up the processes of historical research to history lovers beyond academia.

It is also (to our knowledge) the first time that a scholarly conference will use Reddit as a platform. We are uniquely equipped to integrate video and text, presentations and Q&A sessions, live events and networking spaces, all taking place in a space used every day by many thousands of avid history fans. And above all, the conference will be free and as accessible as we can possibly make it.

\*\*\*

In order to achieve all this, however, we are going to need your help. We’ve been working hard behind the scenes in recent weeks and months on conceptualizing and planning this conference, in the hope of achieving something special for our users. **We are amazingly excited to be taking this step. But, we will need funding to make it all happen the way we envisage.**

We are not a wealthy organisation, and none of the organisers can call on the kind of institutional support that would usually bankroll a conference like this one. While we’re knocking on plenty of doors to try and secure sponsorship, we are also reliant on the goodwill and support of our users. If you think this conference is something that should happen and would like to contribute, click the link below! Every contribution is appreciated, though we completely understand that not everyone – particularly just now – is in a position to give much or at all. If you want to contribute but can’t afford to, you can also help us out by spreading the word on social media! For those who can donate, we’re offering a range of limited edition swag and the chance to be part of behind-the-scenes events and conversations. Your money will go solely towards covering the cost of the event, such as platform fees and merchandise costs  - *not* for paying the organisers or participants.

I have covered Sikh history and heritage for two decades in the form of books, exhibitions and now digital technologies.

My specific focus is the Sikh Martial Tradition on how the Sikhs became a militarized set of people, the development of their history as part of the Misls or Sikh Confederacies in the eighteenth century. This includes the relationship with the East India Company during this time and the interactions with the Governor Generals of the company.

This is together with how the Sikhs under Maharajah Ranjit Singh developed the Sikh Empire leading to one of the most prosperous states in northern India. There was much interactions with the British and after the Maharajah’s death several bloody battles took place between the EIC and the Sikh Empire known as the Anglo Sikh Wars between 1845-1846 and 1848-1849. Leading to the annexation of the Panjab, India.

As will no doubt be known to most people reading this, this morning Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The course of events – and the consequences – remains unclear.

AskHistorians is not a forum for the discussion of current events, and there are other places on Reddit where you can read and participate in discussions of what is happening in Ukraine right now. However, this is a crisis with important historical contexts, and we’ve already seen a surge of questions from users seeking to better understand what is unfolding in historical terms. Particularly given the disinformation campaigns that have characterised events so far, and the (mis)use of history to inform and justify decision-making, we understand the desire to access reliable information on these issues.

This thread will serve to collate all historical questions directly or indirectly to events in Ukraine. Our panel of flairs will do their best to respond to these questions as they come in, though please have understanding both in terms of the time they have, and the extent to which we have all been affected by what is happening.

There are still some statues around which were set up during the Nazi period (mainly naked men and women with tight butts), but I have never heard of a Hitler statue anywhere. I heard about Hitler busts which were displayed in public buildings, but I have never heard of a statue in a public square.

On the other hand, [Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statues_of_Joseph_Stalin) had statues built of himself during his lifetime, as well as [Salazar](http://samdurant.net/defaced_monuments/Pages/Portugal/portugal.html) apparently and [Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbols_of_Francoism#Statues_of_Franco), as well as [Mussolini](https://www.academia.edu/5796254/Mussolini_as_Monument_the_equestrian_statue_of_the_Duce_at_the_Littoriale_Stadium_in_Bologna).

Generally speaking, warmer colors (red, orange, yellow) are hotter and drier. 

I have always found it bizarre how the geographic spread of the religion matches almost exactly with the distribution of dry and arid climate zones (excepting Indonesia). What is up with this? The distribution of Islam skips over the mild climate of Ethiopia and goes right onto the arid parts of the Horn of Africa! It extends well into the steppe of Eurasia, but stops where it switches from warm steppe to cold steppe! I know that geographical determinism is not looked upon kindly, but what is the explanation for this correlation?

EDIT: Thanks for all the answers! I kind of knew that 'arid climate' was not *really* the factor that determined the outcome of Islam's spread, but reading all of your responses to the idea and your explanations of why Islam spread to where it did and not elsewhere provided a ton of amazing information.

Otherwise, we still think you're pretty cool, so keep on keepin' on.

But some people seem to have not been socialized well as children, and have such an egotistic view of the world that they find it inconceivable that something they don't enjoy could possibly appeal to other people.

This Roundtable is for **You**, jerkwad.

Putting it in the most basic terms, if you don't like this subreddit, **then fuck off**! We mean that in the nicest way possible. We deeply appreciate constructive feedback that engages with the intentions behind the subreddit's mission, and take it seriously, but if you just need to vent about how much we suck, just save everyone involved the time.

Here are the ways to 'fuck off' if the issue is that you simply don't know how:

No one is forcing you to come here (unless, again, a mod *is* literally in your home with a gun to your head. Sorry if so, not *my* fault though), and if you aren't enjoying the experience this subreddit offers, we certainly don't want you to continue to suffer for it, so please leave and try not to embarrass yourself by making a scene. The only thing telling us you've unsubscribed does is let me know to add an RES tag so I can laugh a few months later when you slink back in to ask a question.

We don't mean any of this in a *mean* way, but we certainly mean it quite seriously. We have over two million unique visitors to the subreddit each month, and most of them come here purposefully because they find what we have to offer to be worth their time, and we aren't going to go about changing things because *you* don't like it. Complaining about how we won't let you do something against our rules is little different than yelling at the librarian who kicked you out of the silent reading room for blasting Megadeth at full volume, or someone kicked out of Open Mic Night because they decided to literally poop on the stage. People came to that space for a specific experience, and you have no right to impose your own preferences on them or expect your needs to be accommodated in such a way.

You are on one of the biggest websites in the world, which has communities to meet just about every single interest. You can go post on [/r/Megadeth](https://www.reddit.com/r/Megadeth) if that's your thing, and while I won't look for it, there probably is a subreddit to share pictures of your poop too. And similarly, if you don't like [/r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians) we hardly hold the monopoly on history on reddit, nor even on being a place to ask questions about it. [/r/AskHistory](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory) is the original community, in fact, and one which we encourage users to go to if they don't want what we have to offer. Similarly [/r/History](https://www.reddit.com/r/History) provides a much more general platform for discussion, and [/r/HistoryNetwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryNetwork) maintains an [extensive list of subreddits on their Wikipage](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryNetwork/wiki/listofhistorysubreddits) which can provide for almost any interest.

What it comes down to in the end is that the Mod Team here has a specific vision, and we welcome everyone into that space. We don't expect it to be one that fits everyone, nor would we try to make it so. But while we might not expect everyone to enjoy this community, we do expect everyone to respect it. If you can't do even that, then it isn't really our problem, but it certainly says a great deal about you, so **fuck off**.

607,1625489158.0,"Why is Julius Caesar the most iconic Roman in history despite the fact that he was neither Rome's most prolific conqueror, nor its most powerful ruler?","Caesar is clearly the most well-known Roman. If you ask any average person in a Western country  if they can name a Roman, they would likely name Caesar, and it's also striking that so many leaders from history referred to themselves as Caesars — the Prussian and Austrian Kaisers, Russian Tzars, I just read a bio of Charles V and he referred to himself as ""Caesar."" Even the Roman emperors would call themselves Caesars. But why is Caesar such a respected name?

I remember reading from one of Adrian Goldsworthy's books that the prestige of a Roman conquest was based more on the sophistication and power of the conquered people than on the sheer amount of land that Rome acquired. Because of this, I would suspect that Scipio Africanus's victory over Carthage, Aemilius Paullus's victory over Macedon, and Pompey's victories in the Near East gave Rome more pride than Caesar's victory over the Gauls, who were a somewhat ""barbaric"" people compared to Rome's mediterranean adversaries. Caesar was also far from the first Roman to win a civil war, so that fact should not distinguish him too much. And when we're talking about sheer political power, Caesar never even became an emperor. He came close, but was killed before that could happen.

Maybe one of my assumptions is wrong, and I need to be corrected. Having said that, this is more of a historiographic question than an historical one, so I'll offer my best guess. People love a great story, and few dramas from history are as grand as the downfall of the Roman Republic. Of course, Caesar was the catalyst of this. By changing the senate to a dictatorship, Caesar revolutionized an ancient (and very successful) political order, betrayed the trust of his fellow Romans, defeated a powerful rival in Pompey, and was ultimately assassinated by those very senators that he had threatened. It's a great story, and my guess is that that's why Caesar is such an icon. Why do you think Caesar is so iconic?",AskHistorians

But was the unexpected ascension of a 25-year woman to the throne viewed with trepidation in 1952? We have all seen the cheering crowds at her coronation, but was there any disquiet? Was the untested Elizabeth perceived to be a potentially weak monarch? Did anyone worry that a potentially bland and long-lived queen could spell the decline of the monarchy? In short, were there naysayers? 

EDIT: Many thanks for the superb answers from /u/SirGuyGrand, /u/Yorkton, /u/The_Alaskan, /u/24carats, and /u/CopperBrook ! I feel I understand the atmosphere of 1952 much better now.

If I could summarize the points made, it would seem that the British public was already used to the idea that Elizabeth would be Queen, and already admired her. Indeed, her youth may have made her the ideal monarch for the new post-war era. The only concerns in court circles came earlier, when there was a perception that the Earl of Mountbatten and the former Edward VIII were trying to exploit the situation to gain power, but little came of this, in part due to Elizabeth's refusal to change the royal family's name to Mountbatten. 

I suppose one other point not made below is that the successful reigns of Elizabeth I and Victoria meant that there was already a precedent for young female monarchs becoming popular icons, so that too might have mitigated any sense of unease.

623,1683558821.0,Was Cleopatra Black? And what it means to talk about historical race,"Hi all, I'm the resident Cleopatra-poster so the mods have been gracious enough to let me do this Monday Methods post. As most of you know, Netflix is producing a docudrama series on Cleopatra. Or rather, the second season of the *African Queens* series is focusing on Cleopatra, and that season has already generated considerable controversy surrounding the casting of Adele James (a Black British actress of mixed ancestry) as Cleopatra. Many of you have posted questions about this casting and the race of Cleopatra in the weeks leading up to its release. This post will not, can not, definitively answer all of these questions but it will try to place them in context.

How should we understand the racial or ethnic identity of Cleopatra?

What does it mean to cast a Black or mixed race actress as Cleopatra?

Why do we project race onto antiquity and how should we approach this topic?

There's a lot that needs to be said in response to these topics, and a lot that has already been said. 
#Race and ethnicity in (ancient) Egypt
One thing I do not want to do is talk over Egyptians themselves, who have many valid reasons to object to the history of Egypt's portrayal in Western media. The apathy and at times contempt with which Western commentators have viewed modern Egypt while idealizing ancient Egypt has been historically harmful, and continues to be harmful into the present. The idea that Egypt's population was replaced by Arab conquerors, and that modern Egyptians have nothing in common with their ancient ancestors as a result, is purely a myth. Egypt has always been closely linked to what we term the Middle East, and modern Egyptians should be considered the direct descendants of ancient Egyptian populations.

On the other hand, the idea that ancient Egypt was cut off from the rest of Africa and had limited contact with African civilizations is also false. Egypt experienced cultural and genetic contributions from parts of East Africa and Saharan populations during prehistory and in historic times. From a historical and archaeological viewpoint, the prehistoric cultures that gave rise to ancient Egypt are fundamentally northeast African, with important influences from West Asia and the rest of Africa. Whether we look at cross-cultural affinities between Egypt/Levant/Africa, or genetic profiles created from preserved DNA from cemeteries and royal mummies, the picture that emerges is multifaceted.

For a historian that is an exciting answer, because it demonstrates the interconnectedness and complexity of early human cultures. It can also be unsatisfying to some people, because the modern concept of race is binary by definition. Many writers coming from different viewpoints have attempted to place a concept of Blackness, or Whiteness, on ancient Egypt that doesn't fit. Any attempt to transfer a concept of race created in early modern Europe onto ancient North Africa creates numerous problems, and those problems give way to controversy.

For modern Egyptians, the question of how to view their identity (historically, culturally and geopolitically) is complicated and does not have the same answer for each person. Egypt is a part of the Arab World and the African continent. It has historical ties to Europe and Asia. It is a country on the crossroads of the world, which is a beautiful and complex thing. There is no need and no place for outsiders such as myself to dismiss the opinions of any Egyptian today on what they consider their identity to be, a separate question from the purely academic one of describing threads of influence during antiquity. With this in mind, we can consider the docudrama and resulting controversy.
#Finding the authentic Cleopatra
Cleopatra was a lot of things. Modern historians can comfortably conclude that her paternal ancestors were all (Macedonian) Greek. Some of her maternal ancestors were Greek, others came from what is now Turkey, some from Central Asia. It's possible that her mother was Egyptian, and it's unknown who her grandmother was. Roman commentators sometimes considered her to be Greek, and at other times considered her an Egyptian, but always as very foreign and fundamentally different from themselves. She certainly wouldn't have thought of herself as more similar to a Roman than an Egyptian, despite being of mostly European ancestry.

Cleopatra probably wouldn't have looked particularly dark skinned. We might assume she'd look Mediterranean but that can mean quite a lot. Some people in the ancient Mediterranean were dark featured, others were very fair. Her portraits are so stylized and vary to such an extent that it's difficult to pin down her precise features. Imagining her face is an exercise in creativity, not a science. It's true that Adele James bears little resemblance to what we might imagine of Cleopatra based on coins or busts. However, that has never led to backlash against other portrayals of her in film, TV and gaming. Audiences are very happy to consume portrayals of Cleopatra that are probably too conventionally attractive, or are played by English or Chilean actors with little resemblance to the heavy and hooked features of the Ptolemies.

This begs the question of why Cleopatra's skin tone is so important, when the facts of her life are so easily distorted and mythologized. There is no outcry from the press when Cleopatra is portrayed as a drug addict or when studios give her an outfit more appropriate to a fantasy MMO. This hypocrisy was aptly pointed out by Tina Gharavi, the director of the Netflix docudrama, although I can not agree with her other opinions on the controversy. How Cleopatra lived and died has been reinvented so many times that she's scarcely a person anymore. She might be more analogous to a mythological figure, continuously reinvented by each generation. The question of what matters in her portrayal and what an authentic portrayal might look like is not easy to answer. As I discussed in an earlier answer, it has often bee the case in Medieval and early modern European/American culture that an ""authentic"" Cleopatra was imagined as a Black woman. More than anything, the appearance and moral character of Cleopatra in art, film and literature reflects the values of the society that produces it.

From a historical perspective, the substance of a dramatization will always be more important to me than the casting. It is this substance that seems to draw such little attention whenever Cleopatra is portrayed in media and which will have to shape my opinion of the series. Whoever Cleopatra is played by, she must exist in a very diverse context. Alexandria may have been mostly populated by Egyptians, Greeks and Jews in that order, but they weren't the only denizens. I've written about the demographics of 1st Century BCE Alexandria before, and we can safely say that people from the edges of northwestern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia were present. This diversity existed in spheres like commerce, the military and administration. The Ptolemaic dynasty incorporated this diversity into its propaganda, communicating their reach and expansiveness. They didn't think of themselves as a homogenous ethnostate of either Greeks or Egyptians, they thought of themselves as an all encompassing empire. This imperial ideology was violent, exploitative nd assimilationist. Ancient empires were typically horrific; one of the few positive things we can say about the Ptolemaic empire is that it wasn't racist.
#Writing about race in antiquity
It's ahistorical to describe anyone as Black in antiquity, just as it's ahistorical to describe anyone as White. These racial identities are firmly anachronistic and it is the work of historians to dismantle modern preconceptions that get in the way of understanding history on its own terms. People have always had varying appearances, but the idea that there was a cultural or social attached to specific traits of skin tone and physiology did not exist. In the absence of cultural in-groups and out-groyps based around skin tone, it can't be said that the modern concept of ""race"" existed. This deconstruction of race really isn't an obstacle to understanding the past which is ultimately a shared inheritance, and an important recollection of our growth and growing pains as a species. And yet race is a real component of modern life. It is a construct, like money or current national borders, which has a tangible impact on everyone's lives. Because of this, there is a value to engaging with the past through the lens of race.

Racism often attempts to co-opt history, which only works if you pretend that people didn't move around before the last 50 years. The late 2010s was when I noticed a shift to where these bad faith arguments became more mainstream. Those of you on AskHistorians (and reddit more generally) back in 2017/18 might remember the racist backlash against the idea that dark skinned Africans and Asians existed in the ancient Mediterranean and extant parts of the Roman Empire (like Roman Britain). All of a sudden there was a bonafide controversy over the mere presence of people we might consider non-White in antiquity, something that was in no way debatable, being easily proven by art, literature and archaeological remains. The BBC and Mary Beard, a prominent Classicist, was at the centre of it, underfire from reactionaries.

It is of no value to ignore such controversies merely because they are based on ahistorical grounds. Instead, they should be taken as an opportunity for experts to actively communicate with the public, to discuss the diversity in their field and share information that may not have crossed from academia to the mainstream yet. The idea that modern concepts of race didn't really exist in Antiquity certainly became more well known due to these controversies. The AskHistorians community has always been especially wonderful, asking great questions and engaging with answers. People like you create opportunities for public outreach about decolonization and diversity in Classics. Many posts written in response to previous controversies over race in antiquity have since been recycled, including for questions about this upcoming docudrama.

Though we may write about and discuss race in antiquity, we must be cognizant of *why* we are doing so. What value are we hoping to add to our understanding the past? Discussing the historical concepts of race and ethnicity in antiquity can shed light on the development of present day identities or provide a framework for describing diverse population groups in a way that is easily digested by modern minds. This approach must bear in mind the perils of projecting race onto the past, which carries baggage related to our expectations of racial dynamics and cultural affiliation. 
#The series and its reception in context
There is still a lot of work to be done to acknowledge African history, and even the role that Africans played in the ancient Mediterranean. This creates a more complete understanding of history, all of our shared history. That the history of a teeming continent full of exciting developments is relegated to the margins of a mainstream history education education is a travesty. The *African Queens* series is a marvelous idea, although its execution falls short in this case. The choice of Cleopatra was an understandable one, but one that no doubt annoyed many specialists of African history, whose fields are so often overlooked. There are many African queens and other prominent female figures whose stories would interest modern audiences. Not only is Cleopatra already comparatively well known to most audiences but she was the last member of a transplanted dynasty that ruled at the twilight of ancient Egypt. But the recognizability of Cleopatra can also be an asset since it creates more public interest than even most other Egyptian queens.

The upcoming season about Cleopatra has already generated far more interest than the previous season (which was about the much more obscure Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba). This is partly due to massive controversy based around the tenuous proposition that Cleopatra should be remembered as a Black woman, and that is clearly intentional. This was the focus of the trailer even though it's apparently not the focus of the series. Scholars who have viewed the docudrama in advance have noted that the expert opinions on the show are fairly well balanced, with the main weaknesses being the kind of overdramatized scripted elements that add the ""drama"" to the doc. Reading these reviews, I'm given the impression that it's similar to the combination of research and schlock that characterizes Netflix docudramas like *Roman Empire*. Since that wouldn't have made headlines or generated hatewatching, Netflix turned to misleading marketing and outrage bait.

On a personal level, I find this to be a regrettable decision. Manufactured discourse makes it an uphill battle for Classicists, Egyptologists and historians to combat white supremacy and improve public knowledge about the diversity of the past. It creates dissent and hostility, and encourages people to view history through a tribal lens. The mentality brought forth by this controversy is one in which history is real estate, to be carved up and fought over. The superficially appealing argument that Cleopatra was White is easily co-opted by publications and internet personalities who want you to feel that Black people have no history, or that the inheritance of Classical antiquity is in some way the exclusive property of White Europeans and Americans. By pandering to controversy, this docudrama becomes a perfect strawman for anti-intellectual and white supremacist discourse. Here we must again be cognizant of the perils of projecting race onto the past.
#Engaging with controversy
On its own, Cleopatra's appearance and the unknowable finer points of her ancestry are not very important to understanding her. As a conversation starter for the broader topic of race and identity in history, these questions hold a huge amount of power, and that is why it was chosen as the theme for this Monday Methods post. It is virtually impossible not to be sucked in by controversies like these once they occur..

Even regarding historical topics, academics often have less reach than less constructive responses, because news outlets and social media tend to amplify the most polarizing viewpoints. The *African Queens* series has already been written about by academics like professor [Islam Issa](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/5/1/cleopatra-was-egyptian-whether-black-or-brown-matters) and archaeologist [Jane Draycott](https://theconversation.com/queen-cleopatra-experts-save-this-poorly-scripted-netflix-docuseries-204576), and no doubt more will follow.

It is not always easy to discern good faith discourse and from bad faith, but the only solution is to think critically about the past as you consume media relating to it. In order to engage with the topic of race in antiquity rigorously, not passively, it is important to bear in mind the pitfalls of projecting race onto the past, to be aware of who is speaking on it and why, and to always place it in a wider historical context.

With the above in mind, hopefully you will be better equipped to engage with this controversy (and others like it) as it unfolds.",AskHistorians

Also, I’m not trying to talk down on anyone’s religious beliefs. If you believe that Jesus really was resurrected, I won’t argue with you. 

That being said, I want to explore an alternate view. My understanding is that the consensus among historians is that Jesus was a real person, who probably had some teachings that challenged the religious establishment at that time, and was probably put to death at some point.

So what happens after? If Jesus dies and stays dead, how/why do so many people become part of this explosive new religion, under the impression that he was indeed raised up? Was it a coordinated lie/coverup? By who? The apostles? If they were real, it had to have been them, because they wouldn’t have been fooled by a lookalike or by tall tales by random people.

Some hypotheses I've had on the matter include: 

* Maybe I'm saturated in propaganda from an American public school system and actually the dictatorish nature of Communist societies I'd heard about is exaggerated/didn't hear about the examples where this didn't happen? 

* Or, if it was accurate, it was a ""fruit of the poisoned tree"" situation, where since the Soviets went down a dictatorial Stalinist path and assisted the other communist countries in setting up, they imprinted this system onto them as well? 

* There's also an issue of post-revolution political disarray generally giving rise to tyrants, which, when combined with Communism often being instated via revolution, yields a high risk of a tyrant seizing power.

692,1657356562.0,How did Christianity (especially in the USA) develop a significant and vocal demographic that doesn't believe in many commonly accepted scientific theories?,"So going by the internet, the USA has a lot of Christian private schools, and some of those Christian schools teach the 6000-year-old-earth theory and other scientifically disproven claims. The fact that these claims are still taught in modern schools and believed by a significant portion of the US population is quite surprising considering that the USA is viewed as a developed country and has many leading universities.

For comparison, in India (which is more religious than the USA), all schools that are recognised by the government have to use a scientifically sound non-religious educational curriculum created by either a state-level or a national-level authority (or the curriculum has to be an international one that is recognised by other Indian educational institutions, like IGCSE or the International Baccalaureate). If an Indian school is run by a religious organisation (most such schools are run by Catholic organisations or Hindu organisations), they can hold daily prayers and other religious activities, but they don't usually try to guilt people using their religion and they almost never teach anything that contradicts science. Plus, [Indians in general have more trust in scientists compared to Americans](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/trust-science-india-pew-research-center/) though of course [we have out fair share of religious people who believe in miracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha_drinking_milk_miracle).

710,1580122860.0,Special Feature: Holocaust Remembrance Day – to remember and pay respect to those who perished and those who survived.,"On January 27, 1945 the men and women of the 322nd Soviet Rifle Division liberated what remained of the Auschwitz camp complex. Auschwitz and more specifically the death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau was the place where the Nazis had in prior years [murdered more than a million people](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/76avmk/how_do_we_estimate_the_number_of_jewish_deaths_in/) in gas chambers, by shooting, starving, beating them and in many more, unimaginably cruel ways. It is a place that has since become synonymous with the Holocaust – [the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews and up to half a million Roma, Sinti, and other groups persecuted as ""gypsies"" by the Nazi regime and its collaborators](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/564gvm/eli5_when_people_discuss_the_holocaust_why_do/d8g92dz/) – itself and thus the end of which marks an appropriate date to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust.

Yet, while the Nazis had killed so many in Auschwitz, by the time the Red Army arrived only a fraction was left. Some 65.000 prisoners, mostly but not all Jews, had been forced on a death march by the Nazi adminstration of the camp. Some 7.000 sick prisoners and prisoners of older age or younger than 15 were left. What we know as the liberation of Auschwitz is different from the mental image we have of huge crowds converging on the Allies' jeeps as it was in Buchenwald, Dachau, Belsen or Mauthausen. The prisoner left there were not easy to find the prisoners that still remained. And while their initial reaction was joy and emotion, there also was confusion and fear.

Eva Mozes Kor, then 10 years old, describes liberation as such:
> We ran up to them [the Red Army soldiers] and they gave us hugs, cookies and chocolate. Being so alone a hug meant more than anybody could imagine because that replaced the human worth we were starving for. We were not only starved for food but we were starved for human kindness. And the Soviet Army did provide some of that.

At the same time, Kor describes uncertainty and fear about where to got and what to do now:
> I didn't even know where on earth I was, much less where my home was. You had to be a little smarter than I, a ten-year-old girl in a concentration camp to know what direction to start out in and where to go.

Another description of this day comes from Primo Levi, Italian survivor, famous for the literary accounts of his time. In the following passage he describes what follows the arrival of four Soviet soldiers on horses outside the perimeter of the camp:
> They did not greet us, nor did they smile; they seemed oppressed not only by compassion but a confused restraint, which sealed their lips and bound their eyes to the funeral scene. It was that shame we knew so well, the shame that drowned us after the selections, and every time we had to watch, or submit to, some outrage: the shame the Germans did not know, that the just man experiences at another man's crime; the feeling of guilt that such a crime should exist, that it should have been introduced irrevocably into the world of things that exist, and that his will for good shoulod have proved too weak or null, and should not have availed in defense.

Levi, astute observers of people, was right in his assessment. The liberators of the Red Army found 7.000 survivors, 6000 dead, 837.000 women's coats and dresses, 370.000 men's suits, 44.000 pairs of shoes, piles and piles of prosthetic limbs and 305 sacks of human hair weighing a total of 7,7 tons – estimated to be hair form about 140.000 victims. Vassily Petrenko, Soviet General, commented on this discovery:
> I who saw people dying every day was shocked by the Nazis' indescribable hatred towards the inmates who had turned into living skeletons. I read about the Nazis' treatment of Jews in various leaflets, but there was nothing about the Nazis' treatment of women, children, old men. It was at Auschwitz that I realized the fate of the Jews.

For when the Red Army arrived in Auschwitz, it was far form the first camp they liberated. Starting in the summer of 1944, the Soviets liberated a variety of camps, among them the infamous Aktion Reinhard death camps. Soviet journalist and author, Vasily Grossman, himself Jewish, was a witness to the discovered camp of Treblinka and wrote in one of his most famous texts, The Hell of Treblinka:
> Stories of the living dead of Treblinka, who had until the last minute kept not just the image of humans but the human soul as well, shake one to the bottom of one's heart and make it impossible to sleep. The stories of women trying to save their children and committing magnificent doomed feats, of young mothers who hid their babies in heaps of blankets. I've heard the stories of ten-year-old girls who confronted their parents with wisdom and comfort. I was told about dozens of doomed people who began to struggle. I was told about a young man who stabbed an SS officer with a knife [...] We were told about the tall girl who snatched a carbine from the hands of a *Wachmann* [sic] on ""The Road of No Return"" [what the Germans called ""Schlauch"", meaning the fenced in walk way in Treblinka towards the gas chambers] and fought back. The torture and execution she was subjected to were terrible. Her name is unknown, and nobody can pay it the respect it deserves.

As Grossman walks the grounds of Treblinka, where under his feet charred bone, hair and teeth emerged from the victims killed and hastily buried there, he focused, probably had to focus, on the stories of heroism and tangible action in the fac of certain death. But what he imparts is important and relevant still for the Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2020: We need to confront ourselves with the stories of those who were killed; those, who survived; those, who acted heroically; those, who couldn't; and the many, many more who were killed, beaten, brutalized and starved, deported, robbed, and exiled. For all those whose names we don't know, we need to pay our respects to those we know.

To people like Alexander Pechersky. Born in 1909 in Rostov he joined the Red Army in 1941 after the German attack on the Soviet. He was captured during the battle for Moscow and miraculously survived the wave of mass-killing Jewish POWs during that year and the starvation inflicted on all Soviet POWs. Kept in a work camp near the Minsk ghetto, Pechersky was deported to the Sobibor extermination camp in the autumn of 1943. There, he and the the other Soviet Jewish POWs were brought to dig trenches and build barracks and then be killed. Pechersky describes the first da yin Sobibor:
> I asked [Soloman Leitman – a fellow prisoner] about the huge, strange fire burning 500 meters away from us behind some trees and about the unpleasant smell throughout the camp. He warned me that the guards forbade looking there, and told me that they are burning the corpses of my murdered comrades who arrived with me that day. I did not believe him, but he continued: He told me that the camp existed for more than a year and that almost every day a train came with two thousand new victims who are all murdered within a few hours. He said around 500 Jewish prisoners – Polish, French, German, Dutch and Czechoslovak work here and that my transport was the first one to bring Russian Jews. He said that on this tiny plot of land, no more than 10 hectares [24.7 acres or .1 square kilometer], hundreds of thousands of Jewish women, children and men were murdered. I thought about the future. Should I try to escape alone or with a small group? Should I leave the rest of the prisoners to be tortured and murdered? I rejected this thought.

And so, Alexander Pechersky became the leader of the Sobibor uprising, the largest successful death camp uprising during the war. He, toegether with the other prisoners made a plan of both vengence and escape: On October 14, 1943 Perchensky and his comrades lured German officers in the camp to various workshops under the guise of fitting clothes and similar activities where they then brained them with an axe they had taken from the workshop or cut their throats while cutting their beards. They were discovered a little early but had by that time managed to arm themselves. All hell broke lose: Inmates were shooting at guards, running in all directions, and crossing the minefield outside of the camp. 80 were killed then and there, over a hundred were recaptured. Of the approximately 400 prisoners that participated, 53 survived the war, among them Alexander Pechersky, who only died in 1990.

His story however does not have the happiest of endings: He was, as a surviving POW, put in a penal battalion and after the war briefly arrested during Stalin's anti-Semitic campaign in the Soviet Union. Due to international pressure, he was released but still had lsot his job and lived in poverty until the de-Stalinization of the late 50s and early 60s. Even then, when he testified f.ex. for the Eichmann trial, this was only possible under strict KGB supervision. When he was denied to testify at a trial in Poland in 1987 that was what broke him according to his daughter and he started suffering from severe depression and died three years later.

To people like Berthold Rudner. Rudner was a German Jew and Social Democrat who worked both as a metal worker and the journalist. An anti-Nazi of the first hour, Rudner was arrested and imprisoned in 1938. When the German government started deporting German Jews in the autumn and winter of 1941, Rudner was on one of the transports to the Minsk ghetto. A diarist, Rudner would describe the deportation in his diary that after the war somehow made its way to a friend of his, while he himself was killed, most likely in June 1942 when the diary ends.

He describes the deportations from Berlin to Minsk in vivid detail in his diary, especially the terrible, terrible cold. But what he also describes is that during the deportation, he met an older lady from Berlin with whom he shares a somewhat limited space in the train. They start discussing music and discover their mutual love for Bach. Rudner describes how he and the old lady help themselves bear the cold, the lack of water, the overflowing latrine, the standing for hours by talking extensively about their favorite musician and music in general. Rudner describes how he is convinced that probably both he and the old lady survived the deportation to Minsk because they could take about one of the beloved subjects. How a simple act of kindness, of shared passion enable them to survive their tribulations – at least until arrival.

To people like Fanja Barbakow, a Jewish schoolgirl in the Soviet town of Druja born in 1923. On June 16, 1942 she wrote a goodbye letter. She and her parents had hidden in a Bunker in the ghetto of Druja, knowing that it was only a matter of time until they were discovered by the Germans and shot like the other inhabitants of the ghetto. They had heard the shots only a few days prior. In her letter, Fanja wrote:
> This is the last salutation to all from Fanja and all her relatives. My dear relatives!!! I write this letter prior to my death. I don't know when I and all my relatives will die because we are ""Jews"". All our brothers and sisters died a horrible death by the hand of the criminals. I don't know who from our family will survive and will have the honor to read my letter and my proud last salute to all my beloved ones who still suffer under the criminals. [...] Soon we will lie in a ditch. I am not sure you will know where that ditch ist. Mama and Papa can't bear it anymore. My hand shakes too, so badly that I can't finish writing properly. But I am proud to be Jewish. And I die for my people. I want to live and see better times but all is lost for me. I send my love to you all, relatives in the name of all here – Papa, Mama, Sima, Sonja, Zusja, Fasja, Chaca and little Zeldanka who doesn't understand yet.

Like Grossman, we need to pay our respects to Alexander, Bertold, and Fanja and to the countless more named and unnamed victims of Nazi slaughter and brutality. We need to remember and hold up their memory. Not just because we owed to them, not just because it is the right thing to do, not just because of the moral imperative to do so – but also because of what Levi writes about: the burning shame – the shame that the just man experiences at another man's crime, that Alexander Pechersky, Bertold Rudner and Fanja Barbakow and many, many more were killed; the feeling of guilt that such a crime should exist, that it should have been introduced irrevocably into the world of things that exist, and that his will for good should have proved too weak or null, and should not have availed in defense.

Because it is this burning shame and this guilt that we need to feel when we want to take the message of ""Never again"" seriously. It is this shame that needs to motivate us to go and look at the world and vow that our actions need to be in the service of the goal of no one ever having to face what Fanja Barbakow faced again; no one ever having to do what Alexander Pechersky did again; no one ever being forced to grip life like Bertold Rudner did ever again.

Grossman finishes his essay on Treblinka with the words:
>  We walk on and on across the bottomless unsteady land of Treblinka, and then suddenly we stop. Some yellow hair, wavy, fine and light, glowing like brass, is trampled into the earth, and blonde curls next to it, and then heavy black plaits on the light-colored sand, and then more and more. Apparently, these are the contents of one – just one sack of hair – which hadn’t been taken away.
>
> Everything is true. The last, lunatic hope that that everything was only a dream is ruined. And lupin pods are tinkling, tinkling, little seeds are falling, as if a ringing of countless little bells is coming from under the ground.
>
> And one feels as if one’s heart could stop right now, seized with such sorrow, such grief, that a human cannot possibly stand it.",AskHistorians

718,1538996919.0,Monday Methods: On why 'Did Ancient Warriors Get PTSD?' isn't such a simple question.,"It's one of the most commonly asked questions on AskHistorians: did soldiers in the ancient world get PTSD?

It's a simple question, one that could potentially have a one word answer ('yes' or 'no'). It's one with at least some empathy - we understand that the ancients lived in a harsh, brutal world, and people these days who live through harsh, brutal events often get diagnosed by psychiatrists or psychologists with post-traumatic stress disorder (usually called by the acronym PTSD). It's a reasonable question to ask. As would be the far less common question about whether ancient women got PTSD after experiencing the horrors of war that women experience.

It's also not a simple question at all, in any way, shape, or form, and clinicians and historians differ fundamentally on how to answer the question. This is because the question can't be resolved without first resolving some fairly fundamental questions about human nature, and why we are the way we are, that inevitably end up tipping over into broader philosophical stances.

Put it this way; in 2014, an academic book titled *Combat Trauma And The Ancient Greeks* was edited by Peter Meineck and David Konstan. Lawrence A. Tritle's Chapter Four argued that the idea that PTSD is a modern phenomenon, the product of the Vietnam War, is ""an assertion preposterous if it was not so tragic."" Jason Crowley's Chapter Five argues the opposing position: ""the soldier [with PTSD] is not, and indeed, can never be, universal.""

I am perhaps unusual amongst flairs on /r/AskHistorians in that I teach psychology (and the history thereof) at a tertiary level...and so I have things to say about all of this. There's probably going to be more psychology in this post than the usual /r/AskHistorians post; but this is still fundamentally a question about history - the psychology is just setting the scene for how to go about the history.

**So what is PTSD?**

It's a psychiatric disorder listed in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals since 1980. 

**Okay then, what is a psychiatric disorder?**

In 1980 that the American Psychiatric Association published their third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - the DSM-III - which was the first to include a disorder much like PTSD. The DSM-III was a radical and controversial change, in general, from previous DSMs, and it reflected a movement in psychiatry away from a post-Freudian framework, with its talk of neuroses and conversion disorders, to a more medical framework. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the psychiatric world had been revolutionised by the gradual introduction of a whole suite of psychiatric drugs which seemed to help people with neuroses. The DSM-III reflected psychiatry's interest in the medical, and its renewed interest in using medicine (as opposed to talking while on couches) to treat psychiatric disorders. The DSM-III was notably also agnostic towards the causes of psychiatric disorders - it was based on statistical studies which attempted to tease apart clusters of symptoms in order to put different clusters in different boxes.

There are some important ramifications of this. So, with a disease like diabetes, we know the cause(s) of the disease - a chemical in our body called insulin isn't doing what it should. As a result of knowing the cause, we also know the treatment: help the body regulate insulin more properly (NB: it may be slightly more complicated than this, but you get the gist). 

However, with a diagnosis like depression (or PTSD), psychiatrists and psychologists *fundamentally do not know what causes it.* Sure, there are news articles every so often identifying such an such a brain chemical as a factor in depression, or such and such a gene as a factor. However, it's basically agreed by all sides that while these things may play a role, it's a complex stew. When it comes down to it, we're not entirely sure why antidepressants work (a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor inhibits the reuptake of a neurochemical called serotonin, and this seems to help depressed people feel a bit better - but it's also clear from voluminous neuroscience research that serotonin's role in 'not being depressed' is *way* more complicated than being *the* factor). Some researchers, recently, have argued that depression is in fact several different disorders with a variety of different causes despite basically similar symptoms. PTSD may well be a lot like depression in this sense. It might be that there are several different PTSD-like disorders which all get lumped into PTSD. 

But at a deeper level, the way that psychiatrists put together the DSM-III and its successors lay this out into the open: PTSD, or any other psychiatric disorder in the DSM, is a *construct*. In its original form, it doesn't pretend to be anything other than a convenient lumping together of symptoms, *for the specific purpose of a) giving health insurance some kind of basis for believing that the patient has a real disorder; and b) giving the psychiatrist or psychologist some kind of guide as to how to treat the symptoms in the absence of a clear cause (e.g., unlike diabetes)*. 

Additionally, psychologists and psychiatrists typically *don't* diagnose PTSD from afar - a psych only really diagnoses someone after talking to them extensively and seeing how their symptoms manifest. Despite the official designations seeming quite clear, too, often psychiatric disorders are difficult to diagnose - there's more grey area than you'd think from the crisp diagnostic criteria in the DSM or the ICD. The most recent version of the DSM, the DSM-5, has begun to move away from pigeonholes and discuss disorders in terms of spectra (e.g., that Asperger's disorder is now just part of an autistic spectrum). 

**Okay then, what's the current diagnostic criteria for PTSD?**

Well, the full criteria in the DSM-5 are copyrighted, and so I can't print them here, but [the VA in the US has a convenient summary which I can copy-paste for your reference](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/ptsd-overview/dsm5_criteria_ptsd.asp):

**Criterion A (one required):** The person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence, in the following way(s):

*Direct exposure

*Witnessing the trauma

*Learning that a relative or close friend was exposed to a trauma

*Indirect exposure to aversive details of the trauma, usually in the course of professional duties (e.g., first responders, medics)

**Criterion B (one required)**: The traumatic event is persistently re-experienced, in the following way(s):

* Unwanted upsetting memories

* Nightmares

* Flashbacks

* Emotional distress after exposure to traumatic reminders

* Physical reactivity after exposure to traumatic reminders

**Criterion C (one required)**: Avoidance of trauma-related stimuli after the trauma, in the following way(s):

*Trauma-related thoughts or feelings

* Trauma-related reminders

**Criterion D (two required)**: Negative thoughts or feelings that began or worsened after the trauma, in the following way(s):

*Inability to recall key features of the trauma

*Overly negative thoughts and assumptions about oneself or the world

*Exaggerated blame of self or others for causing the trauma

*Negative affect

*Decreased interest in activities

*Feeling isolated

*Difficulty experiencing positive affect

**Criterion E (two required)**: Trauma-related arousal and reactivity that began or worsened after the trauma, in the following way(s):

*Irritability or aggression

*Risky or destructive behavior

*Hypervigilance

*Heightened startle reaction

*Difficulty concentrating

*Difficulty sleeping

**Criterion F (required)**: Symptoms last for more than 1 month.

**Criterion G (required)**: Symptoms create distress or functional impairment (e.g., social, occupational).

**Criterion H (required)**: Symptoms are not due to medication, substance use, or other illness.

**What do psychiatrists and psychologists think cause PTSD?**

With the proviso that the research in this area is very much unfinished, it's important to note that **not every modern person who goes to war - or experiences other traumatic events - gets PTSD.** Research does seem to suggest that some people are more prone to developing PTSD than others. There might be some genetic basis to it; after all, in a very real way, PTSD is a disorder which manifests both psychologically and physiologically, and is a disorder which is clearly related to the body's infrastructure for dealing with stress (some of which is biochemical).

**So, did ancient soldiers fit these criteria?**

One important problem here is that they're no longer around to ask. We almost certainly do not have certain evidence that anyone from antiquity meets all of these criteria. There are certainly some suggestive tales which look familiar to people familiar with PTSD, but Homer and Herodotus and the various other historians simply weren't modern psychiatrists. They didn't do an interview session with the person in question, asking questions designed to see whether they fit all of these criteria, because, like I said - not modern psychs. It's also difficult to know whether symptoms were due to other illness; after all, the ancient Greeks did not have our ability to diagnose other illnesses either.

To reiterate: diagnosis is usually done in privacy, with psychs who know what they're looking for asking detailed questions about it. It's partially for this reason that psychiatrists and psychologists are reluctant to diagnose people in public (and that there was a big controversy in 2016 about whether psychiatrists and psychologists were allowed to publicly diagnose a certain American political candidate with a certain manifestation of a personality disorder, despite having never met him.) But, well, unless psychs suddenly find a TARDIS, no Ancient Greek soldier has ever been diagnosed with PTSD.

Additionally, it's clear from the history of psychiatry that disorders are at the very least culturally situated to some extent. In Freud's *Introductory Lectures On Psychoanalysis*, he discusses cases of a psychiatric disorder called hysteria at length, essentially assuming of his readers that they already know what hysteria looks like, in the same way that a psychologist today might start discussing depression without first defining it. Hysteria was *common*, one of the disorders that a general psychiatric theory like Freud's would have to cover to be taken seriously. Hysteria is still in the DSM-5, under the name of 'functional neurological symptom disorder', but was until recently also called 'conversion disorder'. However, you've probably never had a friend diagnosed with conversion disorder; it's not anywhere as common a diagnosis as it used to be a century ago. 

So why did hysteria more or less disappear? Well - hysteria was famously something that, predominantly, women experienced. And there are perhaps obvious reasons why women today might experience less hysteria; we live in a post-feminist world, where women have a great deal more freedom within society to follow their desires (whether they be social, career, emotional, sexual) than they had cooped up in Vienna, where their lives were dominated by the family, and within the family, dominated by a patriarch. But maybe, also, the fact that everybody knew what hysteria was played a role in the way that their symptoms were interpreted, and perhaps even in the symptoms they had, given that we're talking about disorders of the mind here, and that the mind with the disorder is the same mind that knows what hysteria is. It might be that hysteria was the socially recognised way of dealing with particular mental and social problems, or that doctors saw hysteria everywhere, even where it wasn't actually present. There was certainly a movement in the 1960s - writers like Foucault, Szasz and Laing - who argued that society plays a much bigger role in mental illness than previously appreciated. Some of their arguments, at the philosophical level, are hard to argue against.

PTSD may be similar to hysteria in this way. It might be that there is a feedback loop between knowledge of PTSD and the experience of PTSD, that people who have experienced traumatic events in a society that recognises PTSD can express their minds as such.

**What do psychologists see as the aetiology of PTSD?**

Aetiology is simply the study of causes. Broadly speaking, there is no clear agreed-upon single cause for PTSD, judging by recent research. Sripada, Rauch & Liberzon (2016) argue that four key factors play a role in the occurence and maintenance of PTSD after a traumatic event: a) an avoidance of emotional engagement with the event, b) a failure of fear extinction, meaning that fear responses related to the event are not inhibited as well, c) poorer ability to define the narrower context in which a stress response is justified in civilian life vs a military situation, d) less ability to tolerate the feeling of distress - perhaps something like being a bit less resilient, and e) 'negative posttraumatic cognitions' - not exactly being sunny in disposition or how you interpret events. Kline et al., (2018) found that with sexual assault survivors, the levels of self-blame immediately after the assault seemed to correlate with the extent to which PTSD was experienced. Zuj et al. (2016) focus on fear extinction as a specific mechanism by which genetic and biochemical factors which correlate with fear extinction might be expressed. There's also a body of research suggesting that concussion, and the way that it disorients and causes cognitive deficits, plays a larger role in PTSD than previously suspected.

These factors are likely not to be the be-all and end-all, it should be said - it's a complicated issue and research is still in its infancy. But nonetheless, you can see *many* ways in which culture and environment might effect these factors, including the genetic ones. Broadly speaking, some societies are more inclined towards emotional engagement with war events than others - Ancient Greece was heavily militarised in ways that most Anglophone countries in 2018 are not. Some upbringings probably lead to more resilience than others, and depending on the norms of a society, those upbringings might be more concentrated in those societies. The way that people around you interpret your 'negative posttraumatic cognitions' is going to be different depending on the culture you grow up in. Some societies may be structured in such a way that fear extinction is more likely to occur.

**So in this context, what do Crowley and Tritle actually argue?**

Broadly speaking, what I argued in the last paragraph is the kind of thing that Crowley's paper in *Combat Trauma and the Ancient Greeks* argues. There are much more severe injunctions against killing in modern American society than Ancient Greek society, which was not Christian and thus didn't have Christianity's ideals of the sacredness of life - instead, in many Ancient Greek societies, war was considered something that was fucking glorious, and societies were fundamentally structured around the likelihood of war in ways that modern America very much is not. 

Additionally, in Ancient Greek society, war was a communal effort, done next to people you knew before the war in civilian life and continued to know after the war; in contrast, in modern war situations, where recruits are found within a diverse population of millions, there is a constantly rotating group of people in a combat division who may not have strong ties. Additionally, with the rise of combat that revolves around explosive devices and guns, fighting has changed, and Crowley argued, made people more susceptible to PTSD; these days, if soldiers are in a tense, traumatic situation, it is better for them to be spread out so as to limit the damage when under attack. This, Crowley argues, leads to many more feelings of self-blame and helplessness - the kind of thing that might lead to negative posttraumatic cognitions - because blame for events is not spread out amongst a group in quite the same way.

In contrast, Tritle points to a lot of evidence from ancient sources of people seeming to be traumatised in various ways after battles, ways which do strike veterans with PTSD as being of a piece with their experiences:

>...Young’s claim that there is no such thing as “traumatic memory” might well astound readers of Homer’s Odyssey. On hearing the “Song of Troy” sung by the bard Demodocus at the Phaeacian court, Odysseus dissolves into tears and covers his head so others do not notice (8. 322). 11 Such a response to a memory should seem to qualify as a “traumatic” one, but Young would evidently reject Odysseus’ tears as “traumatic” and other critics are no less coldly analytic.

Tritle - a veteran himself - clearly wishes to see his experiences as being contiguous with those of ancient soldiers. And there is actually something of an industry in putting together reading groups where veterans with PTSD read accounts of warriors from the classics. The books *Achilles In Vietnam* and *Odysseus In America* by the psychiatrist Jonathan Shay explicitly make this link, and it does seem to be useful for many veterans to make this comparison, to view a society where war and warriors are more of a integral part of society than they are in modern America (notwithstanding the fad for saying something about 'respecting your service'). For Tritle, there's something offensive in the way that critics like Crowley dismiss the idea that there was PTSD in Ancient Greece because of their being too 'coldly analytic'. Tritle also emphasises the physical structure and pathways of the brain: 

> A vast body of ongoing medical and scientific research demonstrates that traumatic stressors —especially the biochemical reactions of adrenaline and other hormones (called catecholamines that include epinephrine, norephinephrine, and dopamine)—hyperstimulate the brain’s hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobes and obstruct bodily homeostasis, producing symptoms consistent with combat-stress reactions. In association with these, the glucocorticoids further enhance the impact of adrenaline
and the catecholamines. 

But while I'm happy as a psychologist for veterans to learn about ancient warriors if evidence suggests that it helps them contextualise their experiences, as a historian I am personally more on Crowley's side than Tritle's here. The mind is fundamentally an interaction between the brain and the environment around us - we can't be conscious without being conscious *of stuff*, and all the chemicals and structures in the brain fundamentally serve that purpose of helping us get around in the environment. And history does tell us that, as much as people are people, the world around us, and the societies we make in that world, can vary very considerably. It may well be that PTSD is to some extent a result of modernity and the way we interact with *modern* environments. This is not to say that people in the past didn't have (to use Tritle's impressive neurojargon) adrenaline and other hormones that hyperstimulate the brain's hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobes. Human neuroanatomy and biochemistry doesn't change that much, however modern our context. But so many of the things that lead to these brain chemistry changes, that trigger PTSD as an ongoing disorder beyond the heat of battle - or even those which increase the trauma of the heat of battle - seem to be contextual, situational. 

**Edit for a new bit at the end for clarity and conclusiveness**

I am in no way saying that the people with PTSD have something that's not really *real*. PTSD as a set of symptoms - whatever its cause, however socially bound it is - causes a whole lot of genuine suffering in people who have already been through a lot. Those people are not faking, or unduly influenced by society. They are simply normal people dealing with a set of circumstances that might not have existed in the same way before the 20th century. I am also not saying that people in the ancient world didn't experience psychological trauma of various sorts after traumatic events - clearly they did; I'm just saying that the specific symptomology of PTSD is enough of a product of its times that we should distinguish between it and the very small amount that we know of the trauma experienced by ancient warriors (or others). And finally, PTSD can be treated successfully by psychologists - if you are suffering from it and you have the means to do so, I do encourage you to make steps in that treatment.

It's a microcosm of copyright and data preservation issues that frankly I just don't understand well enough to be articulate on. But I have noticed that time and time again, commenters will compare it, and it's potential loss, to the library of Alexandria, as a means of illustrating the magnituned of the amount of historical data that would be lost should the archive go down in any meaningful way.

[While the library of alexandria's loss was not as devastating as many believe](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5t6op5/facts_about_the_library_of_alexandria/), the comparison reflects an implicit desire to preserve a meaningful record of the recent past so that future generations can take advantage of that record. I'd like to know if this desire is a relatively recent phenomenon, or if there are any examples of people in the past working to preserve records for the explicit purpose of helping future generations of historians understand their culture. For example, would any aristocrats in medieval Europe commission copies of beloved books specifically as a hedge against their potential destruction, in the same way that I sometimes download TV shows in case they get taken off Netflix? Did monks making copies of the bible view their work as an act of explicit historical preservation, or was it just viewed as a means of disseminating literature? Would towns go out of their way to protect historical buildings specifically because they were historical, and not because of any spiritual/utilitarian value they provided? If the urge to preserve history is a relatively recent one, where did it come from? I understand this is a very broad question, I would appreciate even a limited perspective on it",AskHistorians

It was a small hooped object wrapped in leather with webbing across the center and delicate feathers hanging down. I hung it on the wall above my bed. The web was supposed to catch the bad dreams and let the good dreams flow down the feathers into the sleeping person's head (me) resting below it. So my question is what's the deal with these objects? Did any Native American cultures actually use dreamcatchers, or are they a complete misappropriation of Native American culture to sell tourist trinkets? If they really were used historically, what indigenous groups used them? What did these objects mean for indigenous people or what religious beliefs/cosmologies do they reflect? If they are not actually Native American, where did they come from and why are they viewed as something authentically Native American?",AskHistorians

What do we know of attitudes/discrimination towards him in France?","As far as I know, at the time people who came from France's colonial possessions to the metropole were usually a) quite rare and b) looked down upon. So that while treatment of people of African descent *in the French colonies* might have in some cases been less harsh than say in the British colonies; the political climate *within France* made if difficult for them to enter France or even marry there. This made me wonder how Thomas-Alexandre Dumas was treated at the time, since he so clearly went against all these conventions (having a noble father wouldsurely have helped). As a follow up, I'm also wondering if the French Revolution's temporary abolishment of slavery might have had any influence on him and his career.

> The largest single exodus occurred in the 1070s, when a group of Anglo-Saxons in a fleet of 235 ships sailed for the Byzantine Empire.[103] The empire became a popular destination for many English nobles and soldiers, as the Byzantines were in need of mercenaries.[102] The English became the predominant element in the elite Varangian Guard, until then a largely Scandinavian unit, from which the emperor's bodyguard was drawn.[104] Some of the English migrants were settled in Byzantine frontier regions on the Black Sea coast, and established towns with names such as New London and New York.[102]

528 years ago, Genoese navigator & trader Cristoforo Colombo arrived at the island of Guanahaní, in search of a new way to reach the Indies. After promptly changing the name the Taíno people had given to their island to San Salvador, he launched further expeditions to other islands near the area, in what became the beginning of one of the most exhaustive, violent & longstanding periods of systemic colonisation, imperialism, cultural erasure & genocide in human history: the conquest of the Américas.

Today, as it tends to happen every year, the historical discipline continues to face challenges when exploring these particular issues. Over 300 years of conquest & subjugation by European powers such as Spain, Portugal, England & France left a pillaged & forever changed land, in what had been a continent previously inhabited by tens of millions of people from thousands of different civilisations, from Bering to Tierra del Fuego, from the Nez Perce of the Plateau all the way down to my ancestors, the Gününa-Këna (Puelches) & the Aonikenk (Tehuelches) of Mendoza. Today, both History & every humanity have to contend with the advent of many perspectives that would frame any mention of this day as other than “Columbus Day” as negatively revisionist, disrespectful of Italian-American identity, & even as forgetful of the supposedly magnificent & mutually beneficial cultural exchange that occurred from the point when Colombo “discovered” América as a continent. So let’s talk a bit about those things, shall we? I’m mainly interested in the latter point, but first, let me draw some interesting points my esteemed colleague & fellow native descendant /u/Snapshot52 proposed [some years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/758vqt/monday_methods_indigenous_peoples_day_and/):

**A Word on Revisionism**

>Historical revisionism simply refers to a revising or re-interpreting of a narrative, not some nefarious attempt to interject presentism or lies into the past.  
>  
>The idea that revisions of historical accounts is somehow a bad thing indicates a view of singularity, or that there is only one true account of how something happened and that there are rigid, discernible facts that reveal this one true account. Unfortunately, this just isn't the case. The accounts we take for granted as being ""just the facts"" are, at times, inaccurate, misleading, false, or even fabricated. [Different perspectives will yield different results.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6o2oih/monday_methods_understanding_contemporary/)

As for the idea of changing the way in which we perceive this day, from “Columbus Day” to Indigenous Peoples Day, being disrespectful to the memory of Colombo & therefore to the collective memory of the Italian-American population of the United States, I’ll let my colleague tell us about it

>The recognition of Columbus by giving him a day acknowledges his accomplishments is a result of collective memory, for it symbolically frames his supposed discovery of the New World. So where is the issue? [Surely we are all aware of the atrocities committed by and under Columbus.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6x88wm/my_history_professor_stated_today_that_columbus/dmetkv1/) But if those atrocities are not being framed into the collective memory of this day, why do they matter?  
>  
>Even though these symbols, these manifestations of history, purposely ignore historical context to achieve a certain meaning, they are not completely void of such context. And as noted, this collective memory forms and influences the collective identity of the communities consenting and approving of said symbols. This includes the historical context **regardless** if it is intended or not with the original symbol. This is because context, not necessarily of the all encompassing past, but of the contemporary meaning of when said symbols were recognised is carried with the symbol as a sort of meta-context.  
>  
>What we know is that expansion was on the minds of Americans for centuries. They began to foster an identity built on [The Doctrine of Discovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/comments/4sk1ta/series_federal_indian_policy_the_papal_bulls_and/) and the man who initiated the flood waves of Europeans coming to the Americas for the purpose of God, gold, and glory, AKA: colonisation. The ideas of expansionism, imperialism, colonialism, racism, and sexism, are all chained along, as if part of a necklace, and flow from the neck of Columbus. These very items are intrinsically linked to his character and were the ideas of those who decided to recognise him as a symbol for so called American values. While collective memory would like to separate the historical context, the truth is that it cannot be separated.

For a more detailed exploration of Colombo’s role & image in US history, I recommend [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/j9rpqy/columbus_day/g8le1aa/) by /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov

**Now, for a less US-Centric perspective**

In my time contributing to r/AskHistorians, even before I became a moderator, I made it a point to express that I have no connection to the United States; if you’ve read something of mine, chances are you’ve noticed that I use the terms “América” & “America” as two very distinct things: the former refers to the entire continent, whereas the latter is what the US tends to be referred as. Why do I use this distinction? Because, linguistics aside, I’m every bit an American as a person from the US. See, in Spanish, we don’t speak about “the Americas”, we call the entire thing América. We don’t call Americans “americanos”, we call them Estadounidenses, because we understand the continent to be a larger entity than the sum of North, Central & South areas. I’ve spoken about this earlier [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i1ydix/why_is_it_that_in_the_usa_north_and_south_america/g01tvg6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I’m from Argentina. I was born in a land that had a very different conquest process than that of North América, because the Spanish conquistadores were here earlier, they had more time to ravage every culture they came across, from Hernán Cortés subjugating the Aztlans & later betraying the tribes that had allied themselves with him, to Francisco Pizarro taking advantage of the political instability of the Inca empire to destroy the Tahuantinsuyo. However, before the conquistadores came to the area where my ancestors lived, they already knew the meaning of conquest, genocide & cultural erasure, as did many other peoples in the rest of the continent. See, these practices aren’t exclusively an endemic problem brought to our shores by Europeans, because we know & understand that much like the Aztlans & Incas subjugated & conquered hundreds of cultures & civilisations in their expansionism, the Mapuches of Chile & Argentina spent decades systematically conquering, displacing & forcefully integrating many tribes into their dominion, chiefly my ancestors, the Aoninek & the Gününa-Küne, who were displaced & conquered by the Mapuches, who forced them to pay tribute to them, while having to change their culture, their religion, their way of life & even their tribal names, because the Mapuches replaced them with the names Chewel Che & Pwelche (Tehuelche & Puelchue in Spanish), which in Mapundungún, the Mapuche language, mean Vicious People & People of the East, respectively.

So, as you can see, most of us historians aren’t trying to destroy anyone’s heritage, because we recognise that atrocities & cultural erasure practices were very much a thing among native civilisations & cultures. However, it would be disingenuous and plain wrong to try & deny that the conquerors applied systemic policies of extermination in their search for wealth & conquest in América. Even if we concede that a cultural exchange was indeed established from October 12 1492 onward, we need to be extremely aware of the fact that this exchange was always forcefully imposed by the conquerors over the conquered. Last year, we had a fascinating panel discussing the colonisation of the continent with several of our contributors, I highly recommend you check it out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dha7d3/500_years_later_colonization_of_the_americas/). There, I spoke briefly about what made this cultural exchange forceful to begin with: El Requerimiento, The Spanish Requirement, a legal document issued by the Spanish crown that, from 1513 onward, every time the conquistadores encountered a native settlement, were supposed to read out loud.

>To summarize it, it states that, under the authority of the Catholic Monarchs Fernando & Isabel, whose power emanated from the Pope, who had ceded every land they were to conquer to them & only them, & who did so because, as Pope, had been given power & authority directly from God through the Holy Church ""Lady & Superior of the World Universe"", the native indios had two choices.  
>  
>First, to accept the rule of the Spanish Empire. If they accepted it, they were to be treated with respect, allowed to maintain their freedoms & lands, just under Spanish government.  
>  
>If they were to reject the terms of el Requerimiento, the conquistadores promised to take their lands, their properties, their women & children by force & by holy war, as it was their divine right.

So, they gave them two choices. The problem?

The natives couldn’t understand Spanish. The conquistadores read this Requirement to people who didn't & couldn't understand the language. The Requirement was only issued as a poor attempt of justification for the atrocities they knew were going to commit. While in later decades they developed translations as they went further inland, the fact remains that the Spanish had absolutely no regard for cultural diversity or for respecting anyone’s sovereignty in their newfound colonies. I made a translation of the full text [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/e42866/did_conquistadores_or_pilgrims_say_a_speech_when/f96tzok/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

**Speaking of Cultural Diversity**

Prior to 2010, Argentina called this day “Race Day”. Sounds pretty atrocious, huh? Still, it was widely accepted, in a country where, even if tens of thousands of Italian immigrants arrived over the centuries, there is no such thing as an “Italian-Argentinian” collective memory, at least not in the sense it exists in the US. However, when the government decided it was time to change the horrific name this day had traditionally had, there was a lot of pushback. Why? For the same reasons exposed earlier about “Columbus Day” in the US. While most Latin Américan former colonies gained their independence from Spain in the early 19C, we still speak the language they forced the natives to learn, many people still practice the religion they imposed on every civilisation they encountered, & most people ignore, consciously or otherwise, that roughly half of the continent can trace their ancestry to some native people or other. I just happen to be closer, generationally wise, & I just happen to be a historian. So, today, here in Argentina we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the law that changed the name of a dreadfully positivist & violent “Race Day” to Respect for Cultural Diversity Day.

Am I happy with this change? Somewhat. The sentiment comes from the right place, & many natives & experts of the humanities were consulted when thinking of an appropriate name. But there’s still a lot we have to do for the name to actually mean anything, reparations have to be made, for the memory of my now almost extinct people, & for those who are still alive, well, & fighting for their independence & freedom, including my people’s former conquerors, the Mapuches, who remain locked in a constant struggle against erasure & repression from the governments of both Chile & Argentina. There are instances in which history needs to be revised. This is one of those pivotal points in the construction of collective memory, where voices like mine join with the millions of native Indians who still live, some surviving, some striving to thrive, some nearly forgotten. We the subaltern are still here, & , at risk of going overboard with the self-centred ideas, I’m just a simple indio, who learned about their history from their great grandmother, who’s proud of their ancestry, & who will continue to do thorough, mindful scholarship to avoid centuries of history to be permanently deleted from the world.",AskHistorians

my babci—that is, my polish paternal grandmother—married an american soldier (of polish descent) in germany after wwii had ended and he brought her home to the usa on a ship. 

the story of her experience that i’d grown up knowing was that her father had to choose a household member to do forced labor in a camp to remain in compliance with nazi occupiers and he sent babci, who was about 15 or so at the time.  they lived in kielce, poland. i think the real story is far darker and my cousin and i suspect her father was a sympathizer; we remember her saying something about having to sew nazi uniforms with other polish teens and preteen girls. 

she had no contact with her father, stepmother or brother from then on, and by the time she got out of the camp her hair was stark white at the age of 18.  she was so indescribably grateful to be in the usa and for my grandfather, hated hitler and nazis— leading up to her death in 2006, she suffered from dementia and regularly expressed heartbreaking, gut wrenching trauma from that time.

853,1637584193.0,It is said the stoic philosopher Chrysippus died of laughter after seeing a donkey eating figs. What's the joke here?,"Chrysippus was a stoic philosopher known for his good humour. Here's how Wikipedia has his death:

> He died during the 143rd [Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad) (208–204 BC) at the age of 73.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus#cite_note-dorandi1-4) [Diogenes Laërtius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_La%C3%ABrtius) gives two different accounts of his death.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus#cite_note-laertius185-18) In the first account, Chrysippus was seized with dizziness having drunk undiluted [wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece_and_wine) at a feast, and died soon after. In the second account, he was watching a donkey eat some [figs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_fig) and cried out: ""Now give the donkey a drink of pure wine to wash down the figs"", whereupon he [died in a fit of laughter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_from_laughter). His nephew [Aristocreon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocreon) erected a statue in his honour in the [Kerameikos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerameikos).[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus#cite_note-19) Chrysippus was succeeded as head of the Stoic school by his pupil [Zeno of Tarsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Tarsus).

So, I suppose Diogenes Laertius would think either the image, or the joke Chrysippus made, was at least a little funny. Why? Is it because eating figs and drinking is a human activity? Is it because the donkey was already associated with human stupidity (and Chrysippis laughter has anything to do with observing human folly)? Is it related with the undiluted wine? What's the deal with donkey food?

PS: I hope I could add a non-specific question as an extra. Chrysippus was known for being funny, but no works of him have lasted. Are there mentions of Chrysippus' arguments or shenanigans which are humourous?",AskHistorians

I was talking with my friends about day drinking today. I started thinking about how it’s very common in many areas of Europe to have a drink with lunch but it’s not as common in the US. It’s socially acceptable to have a drink when you go out for dinner but having a pint or glass of wine with lunch seems to be considered socially unacceptable or questionable, at the very least. I would assume that since America was colonized by European nations, this was not always the case but I know I could be wrong on this.

>He alleged various reasons, hatred to children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and, finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening.

This is confirmed in his own statement to the court during the proceedings of their annulment, he said 

>It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.

And when asked to elaborate on those circumstances, he referred to her pubic hair and allegedly excessive menstruation, and admitted that his only experience of the nude female body was from classical statues and paintings, which led him to believe that women had no body hair and so when he saw her he believed that she was deformed.


This is so bizarre to me, John Ruskin was an eminent writer, artist and cultural figure, he grew up in a bourgeois and cultured family in the late Georgian and early Victorian era, travelled across Europe and studied at Oxford and Kings College in London, ie he was from a relatively modern place and time and was extremely cultured and well educated; although his reaction was undoubtedly bizarre and abnormal for the time, I wonder if ignorance of the female body to this extent would have been common amongst men of his era and his background, or is this lack of basic knowledge about the opposite sex completely exceptional?",AskHistorians

Nonetheless, after the US Army learned of the Nazi effort, it opted not to implement a large-scale code talker program in the European theater.

Tracing it back, most sources attribute the fact to [this 1942 letter](http://archive.library.nau.edu/digital/collection/cpa/id/44718) written by [Clayton Vogel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Barney_Vogel), who helped establish the Navajo code talker program. Relevant quote below:

911,1459248415.0,"On Adolf Hitler, great man theory, and asking better historical questions","Everyday, this sub sees new additions to its vast collection of questions and answers concerning the topic of Hitler's thoughts on a vast variety of subjects. In the past this has included virtually everything from Native Americans, Asians, occultism, religion, Napoleon, beards, and masturbation.

This in fact has become so common that in a way has become something of an in-joke with an entire section of our FAQ dedicated to the subject.

I have a couple of thoughts on that subject, not as a mod but as frequent contributor, who has tried to provide good answers to these questions in the past and as a historian who deals with the subject of National Socialism and the Holocaust on a daily basis.

Let me preface with the statement that there is nothing wrong with these questions and I certainly won't fault any users asking them for anything. I would merely like to share some thoughts and make some suggestions for any one interested in learning more about Nazism and the Holocaust.

If my experience in researching National Socialism and the Holocaust through literature and primary sources has taught me one thing that I can put in one sentence that is a bit exaggerated in its message:

The person Adolf Hitler is not very interesting.

Let me expand: The private thoughts of Adolf Hitler do not hold the key for understanding Nazism and the Holocaust. Adolf Hitler, like any of us, is in his political convictions, in his role of the ""Führer"", in his programmatics, and in his success, a creation of his time. He is shaped by the social, political, economic, and discursive factors and forces of his time and any attempt at explaining Nazism, its ideology, its success in inter-war Germany, and its genocide will need to take this account rather than any factors intrinsic to the person of Adolf Hitler. Otherwise we end up with an interpretation along the lines of the great man theory of the 19th century which has been left behind for good reason.

Ian Kershaw in his Hitler biography that has become a standard work for a very good reason, explains this better than I could. On the issue of the question of Hitler's personal greatness -- and contained in that the intrinsic qualities of his character -- he writes:

> It is a red-herring: misconstrued, pointless, irrelevant, and potentially apologetic. Misconstrued because, as ""great man"" theories cannot escape doing, it personalizes the historical process in the extreme fashion. Pointless because the whole notion of historical greatness is in the last resort futile. (...) Irrelevant because, whether we were to answer the question of Hitler's alleged greatness in the affirmative or negative, it would in itslef explain nothing whatsoever about the terrible history of the Third Reich. And potentially apologetic because even to pose the question cannot conceal a certain adminration for Hitler, however grudging and whatever his faults

In addressing the challenges of writing a biography of what Kershaw calls an ""unperson"", i.e. someone who had no private life outside the political, he continues:

> It was not that his private life became part of his public persona. On the contrary: (...) Hitler privatized the public sphere. Private and public merged completely and became insperable. Hiter's entire being came to be subsumed within the role he played to perfection: the role of the Führer.
>
> The task of the biographer at this point becomes clearer. It is a task which has to focus not upon the personality of Hitler, but squarely and directly upon the character of his power - the power of the Führer.
>
> That power derived only in part from Hitler himself. In greater measure, it was a social product - a creation of social expectations motivations invested in Hitler by his followers.

The last point is hugely important in that it emphasizes that Nazism is neither a monolithic, homogeneous ideology not is it entirely dependent on Hitler and his personal opinions. The formulation of Nazi policy and ideology exist in a complicated web of political and social frameworks and is not always consistent or entirely dependent on Hitler's opinions.

The political system of Nazism must be imagined -- to use the concept pioneered by Franz Neumann in his Behemoth and further expanded upon by Hans Mommsen with concept of cumulative radicalization -- as a system of competing agencies that vie to best capture what they believe to be the essence of Nazism translated into policy with the political figure of the Führer at the center but more as a reference point for what they believe to be the best policy to go with rather than the ultimate decider of policy. This is why Nazism can consist of the Himmler's SS with its specific policy, technocrats like Speer, and blood and soil ideologists such as Walther Darre.

And when there is a central decision by Hitler, they are most likely driven by pragmatic political considerations rather than his personal opinions such as with the policy towards the Church or the stop of the T4 killing program.

In short, when trying to understand Nazism and the Holocaust it is necessary to expand beyond the person of Adolf Hitler and start considering what the historical forces and factors were behind the success of Nazism, anti-Semitism in Germany, and the factors leading to ""ordinary Germans"" becoming participants in mass murder.

This brings me to my last point: When asking a question about National Socialism and the Holocaust (this also applies to other historical subjects too of course), it is worth considering the question ""What do I really want to know?"" before asking. Is the knowledge if Adolf Hitler masturbated what I want to know? If yes, then don't hesitate. If it is really what Freudian psychology of the sexual can tell us about anti-Semitism or Nazism, consider asking that instead.

[This thread about how Hitler got the idea of a Jewish conspiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4b7lgq/how_did_hitler_get_the_idea_that_there_was_a/) is a good example. Where Hitler personally picked up the idea is historically impossible to say (I discuss the validity of [Mein Kampf as a source for this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4bcxvw/monday_methods_what_does_a_historical_account/d184emm)) but it is possible to discuss the history of the idea beyond the person of Adolf Hitler and the ideological influence it had on the Nazis.

I can only urge this again, consider what exactly you want to know before asking such a question. Is it really the personal opinion of Adolf Hitler or something broader about the Nazis and the Holocaust? Because if you want to know about the latter one, asking the question not related to Hitler will deliver better results and questions that for those of us experienced in the subject easier to answer because they are better historical questions.

Thank you!

916,1555079885.0,Why was my Grandfather in Malaya in the 1950s and why is he the only person I’ve ever heard talk about the war there?,"Ever since I was a kid, my Grandfather has spoken about his time in Malaysia with the UK army — he spent about four years there (18 — 22) and talks about all these crazy experiences that include regular train hijackings, jungle warfare, and working with Gurkha’s. As a kid, for many years, I thought this was a major war, that it was like our Vietnam War and never really bothered to look into it, thinking they’d teach me about it in secondary school sometime... but they never did.

I’ve done some further reading and found that this was called the “Malayan Emergency” but I still can’t really find much info on how it started - Wikipedia tells me it has something to do with Malaya becoming an independent state but then also goes onto say that the British offered them that opportunity and they rejected it (?), so, what were they fighting for? It also goes on to talk about about how this was apart of the Cold War so, was this like the UK’s version of the Korean or Vietnam wars? and, if so, why isn’t there as much outrage about this invasion as their is about the US’s involvement in those two other countries? I mean, it was a 12-year-long war, thousands died, why is it [according to The Independent] considered a “lost war” [source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-lost-wars-britains-malayan-campaigns-5329010.html). They try and talk about blaming things like cinema and media coverage for the erasing of this war from history but that doesn’t make sense to me, surely it should be taught in history class regardless of these things? This was 12 years, many of our Grandad’s fought in this thing, why do we pretend like it never happened?

The above is an album, containing a picture of the RAF Radar Squadron stationed at Ballykelly, 1943-45, and all their names. 

Some background: 

My grandfather, Allan Macdonald, is 97 years old. He is in great shape; he drives, he's very sharp. For the last 20 odd years he's been repairing computers, and donating them to local seniors homes. He drives a few hundred kilometers every week, going out to the flea markets, and driving way outside of our city to his favourite bakery for a loaf of bread and some danishes. 

Every morning he drives over to his local Tim Horton's, and they've got an Iced Cappuccino waiting for him. If he ever missed two days in a row, I think they'd call an ambulance. 

He is a great man, and truly a role model from a greater generation. He's unstoppable. In his 70's, while he was roofing, he stepped backwards off the roof and wound up nose to nose with my grandmother. He taped up his knee and went back to work. After my grandmother passed, while in his early 90's, he built himself a deck, with glass panels around the outside. He's an incredible man. 

He leads a very lonely life, his best friend is his cat Elmo, and he often wonders if anybody he knew earlier in life is even still alive. This is something that I greatly want to help with. I would love to be able to fulfill this wish, for such a great and selfless man. 

I would also like to offer him up for an AMA. He's lived a pretty incredible life. He's done everything from work on Radar during WW2 to solve complex electrical issues on top secret US government projects, to installing untraceable bugs in what I'll only say were some pretty effing sensitive locations for the Canadian government.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

Edit: I want to thank you all very much for your kindness and effort. In the next day or two I'll be following up on as many of your leads as I can, and replying to everyone individually. I'm truly grateful for the response I've received. When I show my Grandfather this weekend, I'm sure he will be equally as enthused. You're all great people.  ",AskHistorians

It's from the Chattanooga Daily Rebel which, as its name suggests, is very pro-confederate. 

This article was published April 25 1865 and discusses what it calls the recent armistice between the two sides. The writer seems to be under the impression that the result of this armistice will likely be the independence of the Confederacy. He insists that it was asked for by the Union generals. He doesn't seem to believe that Lee has surrendered and he talks about the ""flight at Petersburg"" being ""very disastrous to the enemy"". The article also mentions the possibilty of the USA having to withdraw its troops in order to prevent revolution at home following the assassination of Lincoln.

[The Independence of the South-Is There a Cause fo Despondency](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026922/1865-04-25/ed-1/seq-2/). Wrtten in the aftermath of Lee's surrender it argues that France is about to intervene of behalf of the South in order to preserve Emperor Maximilian since the ""grasping ambition of the Yankees"" will leed them to conquer Mexico if they are pemitted to take over the South. This is, it believes, why the North has asked for a armistice (once again the writer seems to seriously belive that the armistice amounts to a victory for the South and has been agreed to from a position of Northern weakness).

I am Dr Karen Dempsey, a medieval  archaeologist based at the University of Reading where I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow - basically a post-doctoral researcher. My current project is called Herstory. It focuses on understanding medieval castles, from a feminist perspective....in other words telling inclusive stories of people living in castles beyond war, power (or horses!!). I am particularly interested in medieval women, my work includes studies of the things they used loved and care about as well as they places they lived - castles. I am also interested in eco-feminism, female devotional practice (in the garden - sowing seeds as prayers anyone??). I am also interested in how modern communities engage with material heritage especially in relation to castles.

I come from an ex-USSR country and recently I had a zoom call with my grandfather and I said something along the lines ""How nice that technology allows us to see each other while talking"".

According to him, the procedure was like this: Like any long-distance call, you had to go to the post office. At the post office, you could pick an option to call through a ""videocall"", he said that the option was only offered to major cities like Moscow or Leningrad. So, when you got your opportunity to make the video call, you had to go into this little booth, that had a small tv like screen and you could see the person you were talking to. He didn't remember the exact time when this was but said late 70s early 80s.

983,1588766728.0,Why did the Soviets continue suffering high casualties in 1944 and 1945?,"This is something that I've been trying to find answer to for a while now. So, a common narrative about the WW2 Eastern Front goes like this: in 1941, the Soviet Army was caught in transition and was poorly prepared for the war; in 1942 and 1943, they gradually caught up with the Germans on operational and tactical levels; in 1944 and 1945, the Soviet Army had complete supremacy.

Why, then, did the Soviets continue to suffer significantly more casualties than the Germans in many major battles of 1944 and 45, sometimes many times more? Take [Operation Bagration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bagration) for example (I'm just going to go with Wikipedia numbers from now on, trusting that they are well-sourced): 450,000 German vs 770,000 Soviet. Or, the [Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad%E2%80%93Novgorod_Offensive): 70,000 German vs 300,000 Soviet, the [Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnieper%E2%80%93Carpathian_Offensive): 300,000 German vs a million Soviet.

I understand that a battle is won not by losing fewer men than your opponent, but by achieving your operational objectives and denying your opponent theirs. Still, why the steep losses this late into the war, why don't we see the same phenomenon on the Western Front in 1944 and 45? Why, if the German casualty figures were correct, did German resistance collapse after suffering such light casualties?

TIK (historian YouTuber) made the suggestion a few times in his Battle Storm Courland documentaries that the Germans under-reported their losses. Is this a significant factor at all?

One thing which amazes me about the Tlingit is their technological sophistication.

Technologically speaking, they seem to have advanced beyond even the Aztec and Inca in terms of metallurgy, producing what I would call swords though what archaeologist want to call knives. [Here's a few examples of their knife/sword style](https://warriorpublications.wordpress.com/2015/09/30/knives-and-daggers-of-the-pacific-northwest-coast/).

They seem to also have developed fairly sophisticated armor using similar techniques, my favorite being this kind of copper-wood masked armor [seen here](http://s39.radikal.ru/i086/0902/f1/3538ecdc235f.jpg).

The claim is that Portuguese sailors actually discovered the maritime way to Australia before the Dutch and made contact with native people, but then pretended they hadn't found it because it would've been in violation of the [Treaty of Tordesillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tordesillas).

His arguments are:

\- Some linguistic similarities between Portuguese and native dialects (in words like tartaruga, which means turtle in both Portuguese and some local languages)

\- The fact that we did ""discover"" and settled Timor-Leste, ""only"" 400km away (seems like a fallacy to me, since sailors back then wouldn't have known they were ""only"" 400km from another land mass, and also 400km on a motorless boat is not an insignificant distance) 

Since I found this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_Portuguese_discovery_of_Australia#Claims_of_Portuguese_words_in_Aboriginal_Australian_languages), it does seem like, even if this is a conspiracy theory, it's more widely known/debated than just my dad.
