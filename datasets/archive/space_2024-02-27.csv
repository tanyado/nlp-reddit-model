I googled Gravity solar system, gravity well of the solar system and so on so forth.

All I ever find is an image of one celestial body like the sun in the standard 'conceptual' image of what a gravity well looks likes.

It's 2024, why is there no image of how this works for the whole solar system, can someone reproduce this for me?

I'd love to see how all the planets are inside the Suns gravity, and how for example the Moon is in Earths, but also for example how the Moons gravity pulls on the oceans of Earth, How rouge asteroids and comets get caught up in Jupiter's well.

32,1708990243.0,Why the Fermi Paradox is NOT a Paradox ,"The Fermi paradox is the discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of advanced extraterrestrial life and the apparently high likelihood of its existence.[1][2] As a 2015 article put it, ""If life is so easy, someone from somewhere must have come calling by now.

My argument: 

The notion often referred to as the ""Fermi Paradox"" is not a paradox at all. It's a misunderstanding of the vastness of the universe and the complex, highly contingent nature of life and intelligence. The apparent absence of extraterrestrial contact is not mystifying: rather, it aligns with a more realistic assessment of our universe and the development of life within it.

Firstly, the sheer scale of the universe is staggering. Even with our most advanced technologies, reaching the nearest stars is a monumental task, spanning thousands of years. This distance alone makes the likelihood of encountering extraterrestrial life slim, given our current capabilities.

Secondly, while I acknowledge the probability of life existing on planets within habitable zones, similar to Earth's, these conditions are not common across all solar systems. Moreover, the evolution of life does not inherently lead to intelligence, or at least not the kind of intelligence capable of space exploration or communication. Evolution is about survival, not the development of technology or intelligence. Many forms of life on Earth have thrived for millions of years without developing technology or complex forms of communication.

Moreover, I believe that the evolution of human intelligence and society was a result of very specific environmental pressures and opportunities. We weren't the strongest or fastest species, but our development of social structures, communication, and tool use—facilitated in part by our opposable thumbs—were key to our survival and eventual dominance. These developments were not inevitable but the result of a unique set of circumstances and evolutionary pressures.

Adding to this, the concept of time and technological advancement is often misunderstood in discussions about extraterrestrial life. The idea that a civilization one billion years older than ours would be correspondingly more advanced assumes a linear progression of technology and intelligence that simply doesn't hold up under scrutiny. Evolution does not work towards a goal of intelligence or technological prowess; it selects for traits that increase survival and reproductive success in a given environment. Intelligence, as humans have developed it, is just one strategy among many, and not necessarily the most successful one at that.

Even considering the rarity of intelligent life capable of interstellar communication or travel, the vast number of stars and planets in the universe suggests that there could still be countless civilizations more advanced than ours. We could be in the top 0.1% of intelligent beings and still not be close to discovering others. This isn't to say that intelligent life is nearly nonexistent, but rather that, given the immense scale of the universe, it's still extremely rare.

In summary, the universe's vastness, combined with the complex and contingent nature of evolutionary processes, makes the absence of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations an expected outcome. This doesn't diminish the possibility or worth of searching for extraterrestrial life but calls for a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and probabilities involved.",space

66,1708844378.0,How lethal is flying by a magnetar?,"Hi space enthusiasts,

A few days ago I was watching an episode of a space show and I heard an astronomer saying that since magnetars are so magnetic they're capable of ripping the atoms in your body apart if you got close to them.

* My question is, at what distance do they become lethal or cause great damage to the human body?

I've already googled my question, however, it seems most of what we know about them is still very theoretical and there was an answer such as 1000km which to me, sounds quite near whereas I thought it should be in millions or billions of kilometers.

* Also, I know this might sound quite sci-fi, but how would interstellar ships hurtling through the disc of a galaxy dodge such cosmic beasts?
* Would their magnetic field be as effective under near-light-speed traveling as under regular speeds our technology permits?

EDIT 1: I understand that space is quite big and empty that the chances of bumping into any solar system is very low but in scientific television programs and space media you're often told that if a magnetar existed in our cosmic neighbourhood it would wreak havoc on our telecommunication systems and fry all electronics. That said, I think I'm either overestimating their power or I have the wrong set of information.

EDIT 2: Corrected my second question.

104,1708659559.0,What are chances of Artemis II and III actually happening?,"Currently, the launch schedule is as follows:

""NASA will now target September 2025 for Artemis II, the first crewed Artemis mission around the Moon, and September 2026 for Artemis III, which is planned to land the first astronauts near the lunar South Pole."" - nasa.gov

Initially, the flight was set to take place sometime between 2019 and 2021.
Since then:

• Moved up to Sept. 2023

• Moved up to Apr. 2024

• Moved up to Aug. 2024

• Moved up to Nov. 2024

• As seen above, moved up to Sept. 2025

Artemis III (the landing):
""It had originally been slated for later this year (2024). As a result, Artemis 3, which will land astronauts on the moon's surface, has been pushed back from a planned 2025 launch to no earlier than September 2026."" - smithsonianmag.org

The landing has already been pushed back, before we have even flown Artemis II. We saw how it went for Artemis II, so one can only imagine how it will end up for a much more technologically advaced and expensive mission. No one can deny, it isnt the 60s anymore. NASAs budget is running thin nowadays. If they physically aren't able to do it, thats one thing, but in this process of pushing launches back years and years and years, they're at best dissapointing us space nerds, and at worst wasting the money of their generous benefactors (who are angry btw).

139,1708573084.0,Triton of Neptune as seen from Proteus of Neptune.,"Hello, I have an astrophysics question that I'd like some help with for a story I'm writing.

Neptune's two largest moons are Triton and Proteus. Proteus orbits Neptune once every 26.9 hours and Triton orbits Neptune once every 141.05 hours. The odd thing is that Triton orbits in the opposite direction as Proteus. Triton is the only moon in the solar system to do this.

My question is this, **how many hours would Triton be behind Neptune if the observer was on Proteus?**

Assume the following for easier calculations:

1. Triton and Proteus are on the same plane of orbit and orbit concentrically to the center of Neptune.
2. ~~Triton and Proteus are moving through space at the same velocity.~~
3. The answer is based on one orbital period of Proteus.

Alternatively, if anyone knows of a web based orbit simulator that can handle multiple moons of a planet, then I'd love to know where that is located to avoid any assumptions. THANK YOU!

I'm currently studying business engineering, which is an interdisciplinary field combining aspects of technical engineering with business management and economics, covering a broad spectrum of knowledge. I'm contemplating pursuing another master's degree, specifically a Master of Science in Space Studies. This program only takes one year and appeals to me greatly due to my interest in space (I’m mostly thinking about it because I want to study an extra year and this seems to be the most interesting). However, I have several questions and would greatly appreciate your insights:

1) Do you think it's a smart idea to combine these two fields of study? business engineering already being rather broad, I'm wondering if this might lead (with the extra master) to an overly broad skill set or if it could actually be beneficial.
2) I'm based in Europe and curious about the opportunities in the space sector here. Are there enough career prospects in Europe's space industry to justify this educational path?
3) What are the potential disadvantages of pursuing a second master's in this area? I'm trying to weigh the benefits against any possible downsides.
4)The space studies program at my university offers specializations in social sciences (a mix of economics, laws, etc.), science, and technical aspects—all related to space. Considering my background and interests, which specialization do you think would be most beneficial? While I have a solid foundation in economics, I find all three areas intriguing and am somewhat knowledgeable about each.

I've received mixed feedback so far searching online and really value honest opinions. Your insights could help me make a more informed decision.

Thanks in advance for your help! (I’m willling to delete this if this is the wrong subreddit for this)",space

158,1708482006.0,What is the probability of interstellar object passing through the solar system?,"**Are these two statements ridiculous?**

1. The unfathomably large number of interstellar objects in our universe is such that, *from the perspective of our solar system*, the arrival of interstellar asteroids/comets is routine. 
2. The unfathomably large distances between stars, planetary systems, etc means that, *from the perspective of an interstellar object*, the chance of it passing through/being captured by a star system is incredibly low i.e. the vast majority of its incredibly long life will be spent hurtling through space in total isolation. 

**The reason for my question:**

Most of the things I have read about objects like ʻOumuamua fixate on sensationalist questions e.g. the chance of these objects destroying earth or whether they are an alien space craft. Neither question is particularly interesting to me.

What is fascinating through is the idea that the trajectory of a lonely rogue object passed through any (let alone our) star system. We will almost certainly never know the exact origin of ʻOumuamua but we can rest assured it is incredibly old and - based on its speed - is likely to shoot through space 'forever' (I am basing this off the assumption that - given its incredibly high velocity - it is highly unlikely to encounter an object with sufficient mass to capture it). 

**Am I being thick or is what I've said more or less correct?**

Let me know if you’ve got any ideas to improve the format, and please share any news-related thoughts, insights and missed stories with everyone in the comments. Sources are in the comments too.

1/ **Intuitive Machines Lunar Lander Launch Delayed** SpaceX delayed the launch of Intuitive Machines' lunar lander from February 14 to 15 due to a methane temperature issue. This adjustment highlights the intricacies of using cryogenic fuel, a method chosen for its efficiency and potential in lunar and deep space missions.

2/ **Ax-3 Mission Successfully Returns** The Ax-3 mission, a three-week private astronaut venture to the ISS via SpaceX's Crew Dragon, has concluded with a splashdown off Florida. Despite weather delays, the mission, part of Axiom Space's larger ISS commercial module and future space station strategy, achieved its research and outreach goals.

3/ **SpaceX to Retire 100 Starlink Satellites** SpaceX plans to deorbit around 100 of its older Starlink satellites to mitigate potential failure risks. These satellites, still operational, will be replaced without affecting broadband service, demonstrating SpaceX's capability for swift satellite replenishment and network enhancement.

4/ **Starlink's Impact on Satellite Capacity Prices** The advent of SpaceX's Starlink has reduced satellite bandwidth prices by 77%, challenging traditional operators. This disruption has led to a shift towards managed services and vertical integration among operators, even as SpaceX's launch capabilities and manufacturing advances promise future price stabilization.

5/ **Greece Signs Artemis Accords** Greece has become the 35th nation to sign the Artemis Accords, committing to sustainable space exploration alongside other signatories. This signifies Greece's intention to leverage its space science and engineering expertise in the Artemis program, enhancing international space collaboration.

6/ **PACE Mission Launched by Falcon 9** SpaceX's Falcon 9 has launched NASA's PACE satellite, aiming to study ocean color and atmospheric aerosols. This historic launch, the first U.S. government mission to polar orbit from Florida since 1960, underscores the mission's decade-long goal to enhance our understanding of ocean biology and climate.

7/ **BAE Systems Acquires Ball Aerospace** BAE Systems has finalized its acquisition of Ball Aerospace for $5.5 billion, following regulatory approval. This strategic move integrates Ball Aerospace as a distinct sector within BAE, bolstering its footprint in civil and national security space endeavors, and promoting workforce development and project expansion opportunities.

285,1707857749.0,"The Three Main Types of Meteorites: Chondrites, Achondrite, and Iron","So I do a podcast (fully independent one-person job) on things that interest me. Currently I'm releasing a series called *Ultima Thule: Unraveling the Unknown* where I focus on how space has influenced both the Earth and humans (including climate change, human migration and tool use, and how we interact with each other). I've just started releasing the first of several episodes related to meteorites, which I think is one of the most fun parts of this series. 

In this episode I explore the three main types of meteorites: chondrite, achondrite, and iron and what each tells us about our solar system's past. I discuss the birth of our solar system melting all rock within a couple of astronomical units, world-ending cataclysmic impacts, and even the meteorite that got even Carl Sagan to wonder whether there was life on Mars. And this is just the introduction into my deep dive on meteorites. In future episodes I discuss how they influence our faith throughout history, their allure to peddlers of pseudoscience, meteor storms that made people think the world was ending, our space missions to comets, and even the eccentric world of buying and selling meteorites.

I put a lot of work into my episodes and all of my episodes have a ""Sources"" page for you to verify the information I share for yourself. I'm always looking for feedback especially for future episodes where I discuss all the feedback I received from my series.

303,1707787296.0,JWST vs E-ELT vs PLATO. Which one will discover more exoplanets? Which one is more accurate for atmosphere analysis?,"Since this seems more of an _open-ended question_ I'm posting it as a thread.

&nbsp;

**James Webb Space Telescope vs European Extremely Large Telescope vs PLATO**

JWST is up and running. PLATO is set to go up in 2026. And E-ELT to be running in 2028.

&nbsp;

Is anyone able to compare these three telescopes in terms of what can be achieved in terms of exoplanet hunt. Number of exoplanets and atmosphere composition.

For example if they look at the same patch of sky what would they be able to see in relation to one another. Eg; TA can see twice as many planets as TB because its lenses are twice as big. Eg: TA is able to see planets 5x smaller than TB.

And likewise in terms of atmosphere composition. Is one more precise than the other? Or are they all able to detect the same chemical elements with the same precision or quantity levels?

From wikipedia I'm aware of this for PLATO

> The mission goals are to search for planetary transits across up to one million stars, and to discover and characterize rocky extrasolar planets around yellow dwarf stars (like the Sun), subgiant stars, and red dwarf stars. The emphasis of the mission is on Earth-like planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars where water can exist in a liquid state.

From a layman's point of view it seems PLATO will dwarf the other two in this regard. But in any case is it possible to put a number on how each telescope fares against the other?

This is a one of a kind, autographed vintage original piece of memorabilia from the movie Apollo 13, which was released in 1995. The hat  was signed by actors and stars Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Ed Harris, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, director Ron Howard, and original Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell and Apollo astronaut Wally Schirra.

My father worked in the entertainment industry in the 1980s and 1990s and I was recently cleaning out his house and I found this gem. He got the autographs himself from the actors and astronauts himself.

Should I donate it to a museum?

I do not really want to sell this, but my parents are now in their later years and on a very fixed income and could probably use the proceeds for health care costs. 

Any suggestions what to do with it?

402,1707286630.0,The Observatory that Discovered Pluto is Looking for Exoplanets with Supercomputers,"I wanted to share this cool case study about how Lowell Observatory in Arizona, which discovered Pluto in 1930, is currently using supercomputing in the race to find inhabitable ""Twin Earth"" exoplanets: [link](https://www.gigabyte.com/Article/lowell-observatory-looks-for-habitable-exoplanets-with-gigabyte-servers?lan=en)

Excerpt:

The search for exoplanets is akin to looking for a firefly around a lighthouse from light-years away. One method of discovery is transit photometry, which looks for the miniscule dimming of the star as it is eclipsed by an orbiting exoplanet. This reveals the planet’s volume. Another method is radial velocity. By measuring the Doppler shifts in a star’s spectrum, astronomers can detect the presence of exoplanets and calculate their mass. Since mass divided by volume equals density, scientists can deduce if an exoplanet is gas or rock.

The biggest hurdle lies in the fact that a planet’s influence on a star is vanishingly small. An extremely powerful optical spectrometer is needed to detect the insignificant change. The Yale Exoplanet Lab has built a state-of-the-art high-resolution “EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer” (EXPRES) to be used in conjunction with the 4.3-meter Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT). But the “stellar noise” emitted by our own Sun could mask the already tiny signal of exoplanets. A way is needed to prevent the superfluous noise from interfering with the EXPRES’s findings.

The solution: Lowell set up the 70-millimeter Lowell Observatory Solar Telescope (LOST) and hooked it up with both the EXPRES and a 4U 10-Node GPU Server, colloquially called a supercomputer, from GIGABYTE. Sunlight captured by LOST is sent to the EXPRES, which splits the light into its constituent color components. A reduction code is used to break the image down to a spectrum—a one-dimensional 10K image that reflects wavelength intensity. The spectrum is analyzed with a special computer program to find the common characteristics of stellar noise, so that this source of interference can be filtered out while searching for exoplanets. All of this is done on a single server that can offer parallel computing capabilities, scalability and operational stability, which will accelerate the process of discovering inhabitable exoplanets.

Edit: I miswrote that Pluto was discovered in 1894. As the article itself points out, Lowell was established in 1894. Pluto was discovered in 1930. ",space

We've already sent signals into space to attract the attention of other intelligent beings. Now, let's consider the incredibly unlikely scenario that the signal reaches a civilization capable of intercepting and processing it. Problem number 1: Even if they can determine the direction from which the signal came, the light was there before the radio waves, and they won't see our solar system in that direction because we've moved on. Problem number 2: If they want to send a signal back to us, how would they do it? They have no idea how we've moved away from them. We might have moved a bit closer, or we could be completely distant. They will never know which planet the signal came from and where they should send it back. **Please tell me if I'm making a mistake somewhere.** ",space

Ok Reddit, I kinda need some help here. I normally don't post requests in any way, but it never hurts to try.  
I'm an astrophotographer from the Netherlands. Our family had a tough year in 2023 when a young familymember aged 14 passed away. His mother 'purchased' a star that I will bear his name: Andy   
Since I'm an astrophotographer myself I thought it was a good idea to use my 1.600 mm scope to photograph the star and surroudings to make a lasting memory for his parents.   
I asked the coordinates of the star, but looking at it with Stellarium, I can see it's hardly coming above the horizon here. It's located in sagittarius and I humbly request if there is any astrophotographer near the equator or southern hemisphere who can point his/her scope towards those coordinates for a couple of hours to make a nice color composition.

Here are some details on it's location: 

It's located just outside our milkyway, at the same height as the cat's paw nebula.   
RA: 18h16m48.237 /  DEC: -36.5510.52

It's a Mag 13,5 star So not really bright like Capella or Vega.  


Thanks very much for considering and I hope this works.

This exponential growth is reminiscent of Moore’s Law, the decades-long observation that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles every two years. The consequences of the continuation of Moore’s law and the ever-increasing computing power for lower costs over the past six decades has changed the course of our society, our economy, and our way of life. Could we be witnessing a similar revolution in space?*

 American and Chinese megaconstellation satellite systems requires tens of thousands of satellites. No way to launch these numbers of satellites using expendable rockets.

583,1706460760.0,Black Holes and their interaction with Dark Matter,"Here's a Dark Matter topic I've never seen discussed and am curious about.

So given the assumption that we're talking about classical WIMPs, then Dark Matter is highly abundant and does not interact electromagnetically with the rest of the universe (or itself).

Given that it essentially has no friction, It won't ever form stars or planets or similarly dense clumps - just discs, halos, clouds, maybe filaments on the large scale - so far so good.

However its interaction with black holes is different, DM *would* interact with the Event Horizon normally (for some version of the world 'normal'), as it is a purely gravitational phenomenon, and DM *does* obey gravity. This means that Dark Matter CAN densely clump in the form of black holes - it wouldn't form them itself, but it'd certainly get sucked into existing ones, never to emerge.

So how much faster should this dense background of Dark Matter feed black holes vs. normal matter?

On the side suggesting they'd feed faster, DM would never be pushed away from the BH by the radiation pressure of an active accretion disk, allowing it to fall in at a rate unrestricted by the amount of other DM in the region - unlike normal matter, which imposes its own feeding limit of sorts.

On the side suggesting they'd feed slower on DM, it would suffer little or no loss of energy from interaction with other particles around the black hole, and thus presumably tend to slingshot clean past \*without\* being drawn into an accretion disk or decaying orbit - only DM on a fairly direct trajectory would be likely to interact with the Event Horizon.

Has any study examined these factors and determined what effect this huge amount of Dark Matter should have on the *growth rate* of various classes of black hole, given our current assumptions about its density in galaxies? Has this been compared against the apparent growth rate of supermassive black holes, where we can glean some record of their evolution since the BB? Do these assumptions line up at all?",space

621,1706238340.0,Question about relativity and the twin paradox in a non stationary universe,"I've always had thoughts in my head rattling around about relativity and things moving through space at different speeds in conjunction with expanding space from inflation / the expanding universe.

I'm also trying to grapple with the concept that, from my understanding, there is no such thing as a true stationary point in space in an expanding universe; as how could one plot fixed distance coordinates in a volume of space that is always expanding. I do understand that inflation doesn't really affect things at a local scale, for example within our galaxy so this may not pertain to the following question quite so much but it's all in my head and it's all coming out right now so bear with me if you have the patience!

&#x200B;

So here is the question... From what I understand about the twin paradox - two identical twins exist, exactly the same biological age, if twin A stays on earth and twin B goes off in a space ship and flies around at a 'pretty fast' speed for a good chunk of time, twin B will come back biologically younger than twin A. And if twin B took an atomic clock on board with him that would support that time has passed slightly slower for him than twin A. It may be billionths of a second unless the speed travelled by twin B was getting close to the speed of light but it is a real and measurable thing.

I'm fully on board with that, crazy as it is, so that's all good. But... if we take into account that the milky way is apparently moving through space at a velocity of 600km per second according to wikipedia, and that rough figure seems to be supported by other websites:

>*"" The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km  per second (372 miles per second) with respect to extragalactic frames  of reference ""*

Then I get a bit confused as to how that surley must affect the outcome of that experiment. So to keep things simple lets ignore expanding space for now and assume there is no inflation. If we are travelling though space at those speeds on earth, and those speeds are relative to being 'cosmically stationary', would it not make a huge difference what direction the space ship with twin B travelled in?

Let's say the milky way and therefore earth is travelling in the positive X direction:

* If twin B takes off from earth also in positive X then he is travelling at 600km/ps plus the speed of the space ship (relative to a cosmic stationary point) So would therefore be aging slower as the twin paradox tells us, as he is travelling closer to the speed of light.
* If twin B takes off from earth in *negative* X then he is travelling at 600km/ps minus the speed of the space ship (relative to a cosmic stationary point) so therefore would he not be travelling SLOWER than twin A on earth and therefore twin A would age slower...?

I know this is massively simplified but I think it gets my question across as it's kinda hard to explain, but hopefully that makes sense. I guess it's some what comparable to if someone shoots a gun from a moving train forward or backwards relative to a static observer on the ground.

I think I have got something mixed up somewhere in regards to my understanding of relativity. Am I wrong in assuming that things are measured from a reference frame of the 'cosmic stationary'?

If so then there must surley be some reference point to measure things against, otherwise (if you ignore the earth and the spaceship) according to each twin they are just moving away from the other twin relative to themselves. Or indeed you could say the other twin is just moving away from them and they are stationary.

Lots of babble and writing things as it came out of my head but hopefully there is a coherent question in there somewhere! Can anyone with a good grasp of relativity explain why the above is incorrect (Which I assume it is)?

BTW this is my first Reddit post so go easy one me

Dear \[Senator/Representative\] \[Congressperson's Last Name\],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my deep concern and strong opposition to the proposed budget cuts to NASA in the Fiscal Year 2024 budget. As a constituent who is passionate about space exploration and the invaluable contributions that NASA makes to our nation, I believe that these cuts would have detrimental effects on both our scientific progress and technological advancements.

NASA plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the universe, driving innovation, and inspiring the next generation of scientists, engineers, and explorers. The proposed budget cuts would jeopardize ongoing missions, delay planned launches, and undermine the agency's ability to pursue ambitious projects critical to our nation's leadership in space exploration.

Recent studies on the Return on Investment (ROI) of NASA's missions, such as the 2017 NASA Economic Impact Report and the 2013 report by the Tauri Group, highlight the significant economic and technological benefits derived from space exploration. The direct and indirect impacts of NASA's work contribute to job creation, technological advancements, and economic growth. Cutting the budget would not only curtail these positive outcomes but also hinder our nation's ability to harness the full potential of space-related industries.

Specifically, I would like to draw attention to the Mars Sample Return mission, a cornerstone in NASA's exploration strategy. This mission is poised to provide groundbreaking insights into the Martian environment and the potential for past life on the red planet. The scientific and technological advancements resulting from this mission have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos and stimulate innovation in fields ranging from robotics to astrobiology.

The proposed budget cuts would not only jeopardize the success of the Mars Sample Return mission but also hinder the development of critical technologies that could have widespread applications beyond space exploration.

I urge you to use your influence to advocate for the preservation of NASA's budget and to work towards securing the necessary funding to ensure the continuity of vital programs and missions, such as the Mars Sample Return mission. Investing in NASA is an investment in our economy and the future of our nation, and I believe that supporting the agency's work is essential for the long-term success and prosperity of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the importance of NASA's mission, the demonstrated ROI, and the positive impact it has on our country. I appreciate your dedication to serving our community and look forward to hearing about your efforts to protect NASA's funding.

Sincerely,

692,1705831309.0,Huge water deposit suspected at Mars equator.,"Mars’s Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) consists of a series of wind-sculpted deposits measuring hundreds of kilometres across and several kilometres high. Found at the boundary between Mars’s highlands and lowlands, the features are possibly the biggest single source of dust on Mars, and one of the most extensive deposits on the planet.

But this dry layer seems to hide a secret. A team of researchers used Mars Express radar data to peer below the surface. What they found was a top layer of dust that covers what seems to be a thick layer of deposits rich in water ice. This map shows the estimated amount of ice within the mounds that form the MFF, indicating that the ice-rich deposits are up to 3000 m thick.

The researchers estimate that the layer of dry material (likely dust or volcanic ash) covering the ice is 300–600 m thick. This map shows the ice thickness if we assume that the dust is 300 m thick. In this case, the total volume of water ice contained within the MFF deposits would be 400 000 km3, or if it melted, enough to cover Mars in an ocean of water 2.7 m deep.

If the dust layer is instead 600 m thick, the water ice layer would be thinner, and the total volume of water ice contained within the MFF deposits would be 220 000 km3, or if it melted, enough to cover Mars in an ocean of water 1.5 m deep.

But a team of Berkeley researchers is on a mission to change this with a proposal to build a fleet of low-cost, autonomous spacecraft, each weighing only 10 grams and propelled by nothing more than the pressure of solar radiation. These miniaturized solar sails could potentially visit thousands of near-Earth asteroids and comets, capturing high-resolution images and collecting samples.""

My comments. Before sending star sails or laser sails to nearby stars, it is a good idea to start small, with spacecraft that rely on cheap existing consumer technology (along with solar sails, and other specialized technology developed for the spacecraft), possibly adapted or improved for the space environment, and resistant to space hazards. With a low budget in time and cost, numerous small spacecraft can be launched, in one go, and at least some of them should succeed in meeting mission objectives, like surveying comets and asteroids.",space

734,1705679330.0,Escaping from a black hole,"It seems to be commonly understood that, other than some quantum physics particles that can randomly appear outside the event horizon of a small enough black hole, nothing can escape from a black hole because it's gravity well is so strong that escape velocity would exceed the speed of light. It follows that since nothing can exceed the speed of light, then nothing can escape once it is past the event horizon.

But escape velocity is the speed an object needs to be going if it were in free fall to escape the gravity well, like firing a bullet from the surface of the moon. An object can escape a gravity well going slower than escape velocity as long as it is actively thrusting out of it, like the Lunar Module taking off from the moon.

So, disregarding all the strong tidal forces that would stretch and pull an object apart and any funky time dilations going on, wouldn't it theoretically be possible for an object to actively fly itself back out from inside the event horizon of a black hole.",space

Helios would serve as an additional stage for the Falcon 9. “It’s sized to max out the capability of a Falcon 9,” transporting satellites to GEO in less than 24 hours. “It’s basically giving you two-thirds of the capability of a [Falcon] Heavy without having to throw away a core and for much less money.”",space

2) Saturn’s skinny F ring, imaged November 12, 1980, from 466,000 miles (750,000km), is a complex structure composed of two bright rings encircling a third, fainter ring. Clumps, kinks, and other structures in these rings give them a braided appearance.

3) False-color images, such as this one taken August 23, 1981, from 1.7 million miles (2.7 million km), highlight the varying chemical composition of the rings, seen as different colors. The C ring appears blue in this composite, while the B ring appears yellow-orange.

827,1705244291.0,83h of NGC7380,"NGC 7380 - The Wizard Nebula

The wizard nebula is a emission nebula with the number Sh2-142. It surrounds the open star cluster NGC 7380, which is also a star forming region.

The young stars of the star forming region ionize the surrounding sulfur, hydrogene and oxygen gas and cause it to glow.

I began to take pictures for this image in late July and concluded at the beginning of November.

The editing of the image accompanied me through the very cloudy time since November and after reprocessing it 22 times, I'm finally happy with the result.

Technical data:

Halpha 351x300sec = 29h15min

Sii.  327x300sec = 27h15min
R.  24x120sec + 29x60sec = 1h17min
G.  26x120sec + 56x60sec = 1h48min
B.  16x120sec + 39x60sec = 1h11min
