4,1709071741.0,Meal Prepped Chicken Becomes Hard,"Hello fellow homecooks!

Recently, I cooked Chlebowski's Halal style chicken recipe to use throughout the week. A big difference is that I used chicken breast instead of thigh to reduce my wife's cholesterol intake. When cooked fresh, the chicken was delicious! However, when we ate it thorughout the week, it had become quite hard and difficult to chew.

5,1709069691.0,Can I replicate traditional oven roast duck with a single breast?,"Apologies in advance if this question is dumb in ten different ways. I tend to overthink cooking. 

Not strictly necessary back story: 

I bought two large ducks at Christmas with the intention of roasting them in the oven. But, never having roasted a whole duck before, I chickened out (unintentional wordplay sorry) on Christmas day and did what I always do with duck - took the breasts off and pan roasted them. This was a mistake. I usually buy ducks earlier in the year, and these breasts proved to be too big and (probably) too old to successfully pan roast. You live and learn. Anyway, I only used three of the breasts, storing the remaining one in the freezer. I regret all this now, and am left with the frustration of still never attempting to roast a whole duck. 

My question:

Can I roast the single breast in the oven in a way that will give me some idea of what it's like to roast a whole bird? If I follow one of the techniques for roasting whole duck online is this a dumb idea? The reason I've never had the guts to roast a whole bird is I don't understand how the breasts don't dry out. Also, I really love rare duck breast. But can I use the singe breast to experiment and see what well roasted/well done breast is like? Like I said, this is a large breast that will easily feed two.

They are really smooth, doesn't taste artificial its almost like eating the unprocessed flavoring.  
  
I looked up for the ingredients and it doesn't involve weird chemicals like we see in mass produced sauces, some of them are sold at my local chocolate shops and i don't think they make them with hard to replicate methods.  
  
ingredients (these are what they claim):  
  
sugar  
  
vegetable oil(sunflower)  
  
Whey  
  
pistachio(%6)  
  
milk powder

27,1708936229.0,Flanken Short Ribs Dry Brine Question,"Hello! 

Okay, so lately I‚Äôve been getting into dry brining and it‚Äôs AMAZING! Almost addicting lol. Normally I make ribeyes, but this time I found a good deal on some flanken short ribs so I decided that I would try it with these, so I‚Äôm wondering: will dry brining them shorten their cook time, so much so that I can cook them like a steak - Searing in a piping hot cast iron skillet and finishing them in the oven for a few minutes to get I nice, juicy, tender medium rare?

I have only ever cooked short ribs two ways before - for short ribs I normally braise them, and with flanken short ribs I normally cook fast over high heat. But these flanken short ribs are different than the other ones that I‚Äôve cooked before because they‚Äôre SUPER thick! So thick, in fact, that they surprised me! The only thick short ribs that I‚Äôm used to seeing are the ‚Äúregular‚Äù cut ones, so this is new for me. 

For context, they are about 1.5-2inches thick, dry aged, and have been dry brining on a rack in the fridge since Friday morning, I plan to cook them this evening! 

Do you think the short cast iron sear and finish oven method that I mentioned above would work, considering that they‚Äôre dry aged and have been dry brining for so long? Or do you think that they‚Äôll still need the extra long cook?

Also, I realize that three days sounds like quite a while for dry brining, but I‚Äôve always experienced great results with three days - the crust is insane, the steak is tender, SUPER flavorful and beyond juicy. But will this proposed method work with the short ribs?",AskCulinary

A sauce that I make a lot over medium-low on my old stove, needed to be just under medium to behave the same on the induction. So the ""translation"" looks like this:

* The entire lower third of the burner dial is lower than low would have been on my gas stove. Nice for really precise simmering I guess.
* One notch below medium is ""medium-low""
* To get medium heat I need to go 2 or 3 notches above medium on the dial
* Medium-high is roughly where the dial says it is
* High heat would be about 80% of max on the dial
* Maximum gets water boiling real quick but makes pasta water foam out of the pot

I can live with this but when precision matters, I'm failing. I've tried twice now to make Stella Parks frosting recipes that basically start with candy. One is marshmallow and one is fudge. Both require very tight timing according to temperature. Both times I think the candy is getting overdone; it ends up very thick, it doesn't whip up into frosting, and the pan gets a solid layer of candy stuck to it.

53,1708877809.0,Need an acid for my sauce,"Hi so when I look I like to do so pretty impulsively starting with one ingredient and then adding ingredients to come up with a dish on the fly (fun learning experience but be prepared to make bad food occasionally). However the other day I made a ribeye sandwich on sourdough with a sprinkle of white cheddar and what i would call a French onion pan sauce. I stared the sauce by simmering a white onion in butter for 20 mins, adding a dash if sugar at the end before raising the head to get color, then on high heat I added probably abt ‚âà10oz of beef broth (idrk I just added it intuitively) and ‚âà4/5 oz of a sweeter white wine plus some salt, this came out to sweet so I added more broth and reduced again till it was a savory onion flavor with a hint of sweetness from the wine and sugar, then finished with a tbs or two of butter. While the finished product was really really good, I know the sauce needs an acid on top of the white wine (maybe even just using a dry white instead) and was looking for some advice next time I try it.

TLDR: need an acid for my onion/beef stock/sweet white wine pan sauce, any suggestions?

With that, they used a sauce labeled Teriyaki to coat the meat in towards the end of the cooking, naturally squeezed straight onto the flat iron, cooked til boiling and then tosses the meat around it.

This sauce, is such an insanely good flavour to my brain that I'm asking here and other subs for ideas on how to recreate it, I have been to every Asian supermarket in my local area and bought the sauces that I think I would need and that google told me are common in these kind of sauces, I've asked ChatGPT for help and inspiration into trying to work out what it is, I've asked the buffet itself, I got silence.

It was very thin and light, and I've had teriyaki before, but it wasn't as strong as usual and given to me on it's own, I wouldn't say it was teriyaki, maybe similar to like a tare sauce repurposed for this style of grill?

I've noticed recently that when I get steamed white rice from a restaurant (e.g. a typical Chinese restaurant in America), the leftover rice is quite mosit and soft the next day, in a good way. But when I make white rice myself, the leftovers are fairly dry and hard the next day. Ultimately this is a minimal difference; I either reheat it with other leftovers or use it for cooking fried rice, and both consistencies of rice work fine for that. But in general I prefer the softer texture of the next-day restaurant rice.

Are restaurants doing something I'm not? Or am I doing something they're not? What's the source of this?

So to try a new approach, I'm looking at the nutrition info to try and see what the sodium level is to maybe get a ballpark idea of how much soy/miso/msg they might be using (the only ingredients with sodium in them, there's no salt listed). Obviously I wouldn't know how much of each, but just knowing the total is something anyway. Their bottle says 300mg of sodium per TBSP!

I did some very quick and dirty back of the napkin math and from my understanding, a tsp of msg is about 500mg, a TBSP of soy sauce is about 1000mg, and a TBSP of miso is 700mg. 

My current recipe comes out to about 4 cups total and uses a tsp of msg, 1 tbsp soy, and  2 tbsp miso, which is pretty 'in line' with most other chili crisp recipes for that volume. That's only 2200mg for the whole batch, divided by 64 to get the per TBSP amount, and I'm down to 34mg per TBSP! 

Now, either this local company has put an extra zero in their nutrition by mistake (although the bottle does also say it's 14% of daily value, which is in line with 300mg), or I need to bump my miso/miso/msg levels to something more like 4 tsp msg, 10 tbsp soy, and 10 tbsp miso (or some other equal ratio). That's like adding over a cup of soy/miso into a recipe that normally yields 4 cups of sauce. a full fifth of the recipe would be soy/miso unless I bump the msg up to what I imagine is insane levels. 

Before I ruin a whole batch of chili crisp trying this - is putting over half a cup of soy and half a cup of miso into a (now) 5 cup sauce recipe insane?",AskCulinary

121,1708551298.0,New Business - Questions about transporting food from grocery store,"**Context:** My partner and I are starting up a social club that serves food as part of it's services. We only operate 1 day per week at smaller volumes, so we may be getting groceries from a store, rather than delivery. This brings up issues about temperature control for cold TCS foods. (Also, we're all vegetarian, in case that helps)

**Problem**: If we buy say yogurt, cheese or tofu, it would need to be transported cold. But if we buy it at a grocery store, it would inevitably warm up during shopping and transport. How do caterers or restaurants that need to shop at grocery stores (for odds and ends) typically address this? Do you put coolers in the car to transport stuff? But what about warming up during shopping?

I want to be safe, but it's unrealistic to think the food would never get warm during that process. My understanding from the food safety certification is that food cannot go above 41F at all. I'm having a very hard time finding resources that describe answers. 

**A related problem**: it may be that I misunderstand health guidelines. I can't find good gov resources that explain what happens if food goes into the danger zone. Clearly, if it's below 4 hours you can cool it back down...but how many times can you do that before it becomes dangerous? We serve a buffet so I wouldn't want to have it in the danger zone 3 hours, then cool it back down, then serve it for 4 hours. But that seems to be what most of the guidance online suggests for me. 

Any advice you can provide on food safety guidelines for cold food, and practically how to enact it would be greatly appreciated. Or even numbers I can call to get information. I feel really on my own here, but desperately want to make sure I'm doing the safest thing. for my business and my customers. ",AskCulinary

People say it is to ""lock in the juices"" or ""keep the meat moist"" but don't really go much further than that. I'll go over what I currently understand about it and what is unclear

What I understand: 

1) low and slow helps break down collagen and connective tissue which turns into gelatin and makes  meat tender 

2) Meat ""dries out"" because as it cooks, the proteins seize up and squeeze out moisture held inside the cells

What I'm missing

1) Why does wrapping in aluminum foil cause meat to turn out more tender? I understand that you effectively are steaming the meat at some point, but how does this actually help retain moisture? Does the liquid let off by the meat evaporate, then condensate in a cycle and effectively sort of baste the meat in the oven? If so, why does this allow meat to become more tender?

My solution has been to order Albanese gummies in 5lb packages from Amazon for about $20-25.  I melt these (about 275 grams as a test batch)  in a double boiler and pour into silicone molds coated with Pam baking spray.  I've been able to get the temperature to about 175 deg F measured with a candy thermometer.  I add 0.1% pottasium sorbate to help w shelf stability (Albanese doesn't list potassuim sorbate in it's ingredients).  Pouring straight from the double boiler pan into the mold, no eye dropper.  Pouring usually goes fairly well, the last few are usually thick and slow to pour out of the pan.  

I let them set up overnight in the fridge.  I've been demolding them and letting them air dry at room temp (65 deg F).  Ive let them air dry for a few weeks now and they've never really got to the consitency that I want.  I want to squish them and for them to bounce right back.  When I squish mine, they slowwwwwly return to their original shape, but it takes well over a minute.  I'm looking for something springier, bounces right back after you release the pressure of your hand. 

Any tips on how to do this?  I know Albanese aren't exactly made to melt and pour.  Am I denaturing the gelatin when I melt them?  

I'd really like to avoid making gummies from scratch but am not fully opposed to it either.

My goal is to infuse them, and I know that might change the consistency as well.

Just found a new recipe I'd like to try, chocolate truffles, the condensed milk kind. Most recipes I'm finding tell you to stir the condensed milk, cocoa powder, and (optional) butter on the stovetop for ~15 minutes or until it's thickened. My issue is that I have a minor physical disability and can't physically stand at the stovetop for that long. So I'm looking for help thinking of how to make this happen. My thought right now would be to make these in a bain-marie instead, but would that mess with the cooking? Is there a reason these need to be made on direct heat; is indirect heat enough? And, even if I use a bain-marie, best I could do would be frequent intermittent stirring so I can sit down occasionally. Can I just let the mixture bubble a bit over the simmering water, stirring occasionally? Will that work or does the stirring do something as well?

179,1708317729.0,Can I replicate slow-grilled cauliflower in my oven?,"First time posting here, but I could use some help! I recently went to a local big-name restaurant (Maydan) with my partner (a vegetarian, FWIW) for Valentine's Day, where we had a phenomenal whole slow-grilled cauliflower. I'd love to make it for her as a treat, but am unsure how to proceed, given our practical limitations.

I got the restaurant's cookbook, which has the recipe, but it calls specifically for a charcoal grill. In particular, it says to do two-zone grilling, with the cauliflower slowly cooking on the cooler side covered for at least an hour, and then switching to the hot zone for a few minutes to finish it. Unfortunately, we live in an apartment with a galley kitchen (with little ventilation) and have no place to grill, so I'm wondering if it's possible to come close without a grill, and without creating a ton of smoke (since all that would do is set off the fire alarm). I've done standard googling, of course, but am having trouble finding anything on this particular problem.

My thoughts were to slow-cook it in the oven (maybe 200 degrees or so) for the first portion, then turn on the broiler to do the hot-zone portion, and possibly add a bit of smoked paprika at the end to get a smokier taste (even it wouldn't get the full charcoal taste, of course). Since it's a vegetable, I'm not as concerned as I would be with meat about it getting mushy in its own juices, but I could try a grill pan if that turns out to be an issue. (Otherwise I'd just use my default sheet pan, likely with some foil lining.) 

So, would that work? I'd appreciate any suggestions.

197,1708287894.0,Did I undercook my beef shin?,"Let me start with this as a little bit of background story and please help me get this straight in my head:

My favourite soup on the world is pho and I occasionally eat it with beef. I would always order it with beef but I either get the most tender beautiful meat or I get this thin but super marbled fatty stuff that is 80% unpleasant and I almost throw up chewing on it. (I guess that is called gristle?)

I tried to cook a vegetable beef shin soup myself to see if this is something that happens because of technique or simply bad quality meat in the restaurant where I had those mixed experiences with beef. This was my first time working with beef but i cleaned it up as much as possible spent literally 1,5 hours and I cut it up into thin 1inch long slices which had barely any visible fat on them.

As it was my first time cooking a beef soup I checked multiple recipes and for shin all of them told me to cook for at least 1,5-2 hours + another 30-40minutes for the vegetables, and so I did almost cook it for 3 hours.

Long story short at around the 1,5 hour mark when I wanted to see how tender the meat is I noticed that almost EVERY cube/slice is full of marbles, totally full of gristle like literally half of the meat is gone or became gristle even thought there was no visible sign of it when it was raw.

Some pictures of it after I finished the 3 hour cooking process: [https://imgur.com/a/7DMttwy](https://imgur.com/a/7DMttwy)

My question: Did I end up with this because I did not cook the meet enough or was this simply a bad quality beef shin that I got from the butcher? I barely see any info on this nor did I find any picture of similar gristlyness on any google picture where I tried to look up the topic.

What can be done to get rid of this? This was not visible to me at all when I put these slices in so I guess the only way would be to cook it and try to render it down into gelatin? 

Can I even get to such temperature with a soup or should I put the meat in the oven first until this unpleasant fatty gristle is gone then put it into a soup? 

Is this even something that people try to get rid off or its just accepted that this cut of the beef is just this way? 

Can you guys help me get this whole ordeal straight? :D

Hello! I've been trying off and on for the past few months to nail a pad Thai recipe as it's my boyfriend's favorite dish, but I'm at a loss. I've done my fair share of research and feel like I'm getting all the ingredients right (the flavor is definitely there imo) but I either don't have the right ratios or my execution needs updating.

For my most recent tries, I've been keeping it pretty close to [this recipe](https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/homemade-pad-thai) as it seems to have the best balance of ingredients I can find (usually, I'm seeing a lot more fish sauce in some other recipes online, and while I don't mind it, my boyfriend hates the apartment smelling like a fish market). The only change I've made to this recipe is I use tamarind concentrate in a 1/3 cup to 1/3 cup ratio concentrate:water (pulp can be difficult to find at the Asian market near me) and omit the zha cai.

I also recently got a wok, which I do feel has helped me to get it closer to where I want it to be.  
My issues are as follows:

* It feels like as soon as I add everything together, the sauce takes on a consistency that's not too appealing, especially when I add the eggs (I think a small bit of the eggs are getting mixed in the sauce before they fully scramble, giving it an almost carbonara look and feel)
* My bf, an admittedly picky eater, still says something is missing, though he doesn't have much cooking knowledge, so it's been difficult to figure out what's wrong

I used to meal prep egg white frittatas for the week, but they often turned soggy and lost their freshness. So, I started saut√©ing the veggies and vacuum-sealing them instead. During the week, I bake frittatas with these saut√©ed veggies.

I'm wondering if what I'm doing is optimal. Does vacuum-sealing saut√©ed vegetables actually improve their freshness and lifespan? Should I be using a cheesecloth to extract water from the veggies first, or do wet veggies last just as long when vacuum-sealed? Cheers!",AskCulinary

At first I figured this can't be much different from Bisquick baking mix, which has a metric ton of recipe ideas in the webosphere.  It's really just premixed flour, baking powder, and salt, right?  But then I read that waffle batter isn't an exact replacement for pancakes, so I might run into troubles trying to use this powder in equal amounts for recipes using pancake mix.  But is the difference between waffle and pancake batter really just a matter of which wet ingredients are used?

More details:

I just purchased a Falcon WT-3060-SSU table. It's 304 stainless steel. I put it together and proceeded to wash with dawn dish soap and then rinse the whole thing, washed and rinsed again, followed by sanitizing with a 100ppm bleach solution.

Is this entirely normal? And is it a safety concern if I had turned my dough out onto the surface without wiping?

304,1707842910.0,Butter vs margarine in danish dough,"Hi‚Äî
(I‚Äôm an amateur home baker who loves experimenting with all things pastry!) 

I made my first patch of danish from the CIA Professional Pastry Chef cookbook, but decided to sub the margarine he calls for with butter and learned the hard way about the difference in smoke point between butter and margarine!  (The pastries still came out phenomenal but it took a few days to rid my kitchen of the smoke smell!!). I want to try again, I want to stick with a butter pastry dough because I prefer the flavor (and I still got phenomenal flakey layers last time with the butter so, even if there was a flakiness/texture trade off, it was minimal for keeping the buttery flavor). 

His small batch danish dough uses equal weight margarine and flour. All the other butter based danish recipes I see have about a 2:1 flour to butter ratio.  

Questions: 1) is there somethjng about the margarine that allows for packing more of it in the danish dough?  Or could I use the same 1:1 ratio of butter too?  Or does the higher water content of butter give a decent amount of steam for proofing layers so you don‚Äôt need as much? And 2) with a butter smoke point at 350F, is that what a butter based danish dough should be baked at (the margarine based one calls for baking at 425F). I know the high heat allows for a fast steam escape to allow those layers to really poof. Is there a case for preheating to higher for butter (say 400F) the lowering oven temp to 350F after a few minutes to try to generate the initial high heat steam release without generating the smoke from the butter?

Other than the smoke the last batch came out so well that I don‚Äôt want to turn to a different recipe. But I‚Äôm not not sure if just subbing butter and lowering baking temp will lead to radically different results to the point that it‚Äôs not worth it, and I need an entirely different formulation for a butter-based danish pastry.",AskCulinary

337,1707689620.0,parchment paper burned into tart crust - why?,"Okay, we attempted to make a fruit tart with peaches, nectarines and strawberries. I don't know what went wrong, but after about 15 minutes in the oven, the smoke detectors went nuts and the whole bottom of our tart had gone far beyond the land of caramelization and into the world of burnt-to-shit food. The whole thing was supposed to cook for another 20-25 minutes, so I'm mostly just surprised by how quickly this happened and think it's got to be related to the sugar content, somehow. Hypotheses listed out below.

Here's the recipe and photos: https://imgur.com/a/N8CPN3B

The recipe calls for a few things that I think could be behind our failure:

1. Using (defunct) parchment paper. (My partner is blaming it on this, but I'm not personally as sure.) I double checked what we used and it's rated for up to 400 degrees, AND the ends aren't burnt at all - only the area underneath the puff pastry crust.
2. Sprinkling sugar on top of said parchment paper, beneath pastry crust. We didn't opt to get demerara sugar and instead used brown sugar - which SEEMED like a fine substitute according to the internet, but may be what went wrong? 
3. Pouring remaining fruit juices onto sliced fruit + crust before putting in the oven. There's a drip pattern on the edge of the paper (can be seen in photo) that's similarly burnt to the bottom of the tart. I'm curious if the fruit juices spilled out and got under the crust, and the sugars in *that* are what caused the burn. Obviously, as the fruit cooked, more juice was released, but I would have expected that to make the bottom soggy instead of burning to a crisp. 

Other note: we did double the recipe and put each tart on its own baking sheet. The same issue happened on both, so it seems unlikely that the baking sheet was the problem. Any thoughts? I'm not much of a baker, so I'm not used to troubleshooting things like this.",AskCulinary

With a 2lbs slab of pork belly, I made Siu Yuk today. However the result of the crispy skin did not turn out as expected.

Here are the steps I took:

1. Wash & Par Boil for \~1min per side
2. Put in cold water and shaved the skin for dirt and hair
3. Shanked the skin with skewers to make air holes
4. Salt (Table) skin to pull moisture - 15min; Then scrape salt off with knife and wipe with p towel
5. Brushed on white vinegar
6. Refrigerated on a plate wrapped like a boat, skin facing up - overnight
7. Preheat airfrayer to 400F. Add water to airfrayer
8. Pork Belly in airfrayer above the water
9. Lower temp to 375F once pork belly added, roast for 25min, then roast at 390F for 30min

I would check on the it every 5-10mins The edges came a long but the centre never got crispy. I saw that it was starting the get very charred on the edges but was reluctant to take it out since the middle skin was stuff soft. Took it out after an 1hr and let it sit for 30mins.

It came out way overcooked pork-belly  had really crispy edges on the skin but also a section of soggy skin in the centre. During roasting there would be puddles of meat juice or vinegar collecting in the chewy area. My suspicion is that I make have poked holes that went too deep and the juices from meat released on the the skin surface causing it to be soggy.

When we poke the holes, do we need to penetrate the skin?

Should I continue to brush vinegar on the skin throughout roasting?

Once the roast pork cooled, the skin become tough and chewy.

Also was very salty, should I be using table salt to take out the moisture?

I have another 2lbs slab that Im going to take another crack at, hoping it comes out better the second time. Thanks!

448,1707261348.0,"Unbearably hot chili crisp, best way to reduce/dilute its heat?","Hi, a couple of months ago I made a batch of chili crisp, with fried onions, garlic, and peanuts. 

I used hot neutral oil poured on a mix of whole dried chiles from sichuan that I ground, and gochugaru.

This is the second time I've made it, but it's orders of magnitude spicier than the first time, a single teaspoon in a plate will make it very spicy, and even though I like spicy food it's a bit much, specially since I want to use large quantities of it due to the fried crispy ingredients.

Should I simply make a fragrant oil and dilute it until its bearable? Is there any other option? I fear the solids will remain spicy (though being able to use the liquid would be a win in and of itself)

Thanks for any help!

Edit: Yesterday I made a batch of crispy fried onions with plenty of leftover onion-oil, I mixed a couple tablespoons of the spicy crunch into a cup of the oil and it was fantastic, so I'm most likely going to make some fragrant oil with onions, scallions, garlic, ginger, spices, etc, and dilute the spicy crunch, thanks everyone for the comments!",AskCulinary

498,1707107854.0,Amateur home cook looking to upgrade his knives: what should I look for?,"Hi all,

I'm a *very* amateur cook, working in my compact little home kitchen. Years ago, when I first moved into my own place, I bought a knife set from Boscov's that I've been using ever since. That said, I love cooking and I'd like to downsize what I'm currently working with to some degree---there are a few knives that I could probably count the number of times I've used on my fingers. I'd also like to upgrade my knives to a better quality... which also ties into the downsizing, as it would be very cost-prohibitive to invest in a comparable knife set at a higher level.  


I've repeatedly seen the advice that the best knife set is the one you put together for yourself. My question is basically what styles/types of knives should I prioritize?  


My diet largely revolves around Weight Watchers recipes right now, so lots of veggies and poultry currently meet my blades. I'm not sure if this info helps, but i figure it is best to include it. Thanks!",AskCulinary

518,1707011641.0,How can I rescue a grainy/gritty frozen quesadilla mixture?,"EDIT: What I ended up doing with this was, I put the whole mixture in a pot, simmered it until most of the extra liquid from the ice crystals and frozen veggies cooked off, added 2-3 American cheese slices to try to rescue the texture, and added refried beans. I served it as a sauce with pasta shells. I meal prep for the week so I divided it into 4 servings, topping each on the day of with breadcrumbs and crispy fried onions. On Day 1 it was decent but not great. I was almost able to finish it, which is a huge improvement compared to the original quesadilla which I had to throw out after a couple bites. The good news is that for some reason, it tastes way better as leftovers, so Days 2-4 were actually enjoyable and tasty. Day 1 had that grainy texture a lot more obviously than the other days, somehow. Glad to have gotten the suggestions! Thank you!

_

The mixture consists of bell pepper, pinto beans, jalapeno, red onion, corn, and cheddar cheese I shredded myself. Spices are chipotle chili powder / chili powder and cumin, and salt and pepper ofc. I'm pretty sure the cheese is the reason for the grittiness, but insight on this would be appreciated.

I previously had success freezing cheese in the form of breakfast burrito mixture, so I didn't think twice freezing this. I think the problem might have been that I thawed it and then refroze it, but I'm not sure. I hope it's that.

Anyway, I couldn't manage to eat it for its intended purpose so I'm trying to workshop ideas to rescue it. The taste is ok (maybe could use a lil salt) but the texture is awful. Right now I'm thinking of maybe trying to somehow bind it together, coat in egg and breadcrumbs and fry it? But it's pretty loose and I'm not sure if I could make that work.

I only made this to freeze it for meal prep so I didn't even get to enjoy it normally :'( I know it was once good because I taste as I go. RIP.

525,1706998827.0,Double boiler for Carnitas: will it work?,"Hello all,

So I‚Äôve recently discovered the confit method, and I‚Äôve had varying degrees of success, my oven is an old piece of crap which apparently has a really hard time maintaining a 200 degree temperature. What usually ends up happening when I try to confit at 200, at the time specified in the recipe the food is significantly colder than it should be, so I end up cranking up the heat to 250 or so we can eat before 9 o‚Äôclock, and the meat ends up over cooked (I was cooking some fairly thin New York strips, maybe with a huge pork shoulder that 50 degree jump wouldn‚Äôt be enough to dry it out quite so fast, but I‚Äôd like to avoid the issue altogether)
  So my for my carnitas, my idea is to take a double boiler; and melt the lard in that and hopefully on the stove maintaining a temperature of 200 degrees or so will be easier, with both the steam ‚Äúlayer‚Äù and the 6 pounds of lard both acting as temperature buffers, so even if my water in the double boiler actually starts to boil, I‚Äôll be able to catch it before the meat itself gets hot enough to dry out.
  Does this make sense? Anyone see any flaws in my plan? Would you suggest cooking with lid on or off? I‚Äôm expecting approx 10 hrs for a 9 pounder shoulder cut into 2‚Äù chunks, but will play it by ear.
  And yes, I realize that the obvious solution to this would be to just Sous Vide the lard sack, but I don‚Äôt own one yet.

  Also, on a different note, I don‚Äôt have access to anything but ‚Äúsnow cap‚Äù store bought lard.. is there anything I can do to flavor this a little bit before cooking the carnitas? I‚Äôm a little concerned that using enough large to fully submerge the meat could dilute the flavor quite a bit. I saved the fat from a package of bacon this morning, I was considering adding that. I also have a bottle of bone broth concentrate I was thinking might help, or would the beef flavor from that be off-putting in Carnitas?

I'm probably over thinking it, but want to get it mostly right at the first crack since it'll be used again and again for a while.

The overall structure of it I'm comfortable with, been using Mirepoix as bases in a lot of things.

My question is the bones. I asked local butcher for veal bones, but I guess they don't get marrow bones, they get a 'mixed bag' from the supplier and they said a lot of rib bones in it. Everything I've read so far is that you really need the marrow, veal preferred because it has more collagen (I don't know if collagen comes from the bone itself or the marrow).

So would the strategy then be to say, get normal beef marrow bones, oxtail and some neck bones, some with meat on it and some else and mix it in with the veal bones? [This is what I'm referencing now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7UQeouQrfE).

A few complications, in [her video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLYDjuEHrT0) she calls it 'full milk powder', which I'm inferring is whole milk powder, and when I checked my grocery store all they carried was skim milk powder. How much of an impact would this have if I didn't make any further alterations to her recipe (i.e. adding more fat in).  
I also don't want to replace the milk powder with actual milk for a number of reasons. All the liquid in this recipe is called for in either the tangzhong or poolish, and I don't want to mess around with adding milk to either of those. Also I'm slightly lactose intolerant (usually fine with butter and cheeses, but actually drinking milk gives me bad gas), so I don't typically have milk on hand.

But my poor wife already struggles with 1) finding the time and 2) the energy to stand there and shred 2 or 3 blocks of cheese. We usually tag team it, but it's annoying for both of us.

So I'm looking for an upgrade. By default, I'm looking at finally investing in a stand mixer that has cheese shredding attachments available. No, this isn't a brand question - I'm good there. But I'm not sure if that's the best tool for the job or maybe it's overkill? Perhaps a cheaper food processor would do the job better? I have a crappy little walmart one, but it's not good at it.. maybe there's a better one for that? The stand mixer idea is a bit more attractive because I like the idea of having more options like grinding my own beef for burgers, but I also know that that's another task that's better suited to a dedicated tool than a ""jack of all trades"" stand mixer. But maybe I'll never even do stuff like that or making bread dough, so it could be a complete waste. I tend to get bored with hobbies quickly, but the cheese must always be shredded.

tl;dr:  I'm searching for a good, electronic or motorized cheese shredding tool to simply my cooking life. I don't mind spending some cash for this luxury. Any tips on the type of tool that works best for this application?",AskCulinary

Sorry I'm a beginner. 

For context: I'm attempting a smoked gouda cheese sauce that will remain in a crockpot and be used for dipping a variety of other foods (homemade pretzels and veggies). My problem with homemade cheese sauces is that they either A. End up watery and don't stick to food super well Or B. Are grainy. I just want a creamy cheese sauce that isn't stringy like mozzarella sticks..isn't broth...and isn't gritty. Lol so I was thinking of subbing the milk in the recipe for heavy cream but I was afraid of adding water because I want it to be a thicker sauce so people can actually dip in it. 

So far I just keep seeing ""dilute it to make the fat content right for the recipe"" but...what if I don't? What exactly would having more fat do to my recipe and will it really be bad? 

Sorry if it's dumb I just am trying to understand the why along with the what.

Is there a way to stop the clumps from forming in the first place? Add it to hotter water (and obvi cool before feeding)? Add the LBG and formula powder at the same time? My hot water machine can keep water heated up to 158F. I use LBG from Modernist Pantry.

I can't figure out the last step.,"I've been trying to make candied japanese beans (picture here: https://imgur.com/a/DNUP9l9 ) with varying levels of success. I'm having problems with the final step of coating the beans with sugar. Immediately after I apply the sugar the beans look perfect, but after they sit for a few minutes the sugar starts to absorb moisture from the beans, and it ends up looking like I didn't even add any sugar. I've tried a few things to fix this with no success. 

I've tried drying the beans in the oven briefly before applying the sugar but this causes the beans to be too dry and the sugar no longer adheres to the surface. I tried using the oven to dry out the beans after applying the sugar which ends up being a hit or miss -- part of the batch comes out perfect, but the smaller beans become dry and brittle. 

The only method that sort of works is repeatedly coating in sugar, but the end result doesn't look like the pictures anymore, because there is evidently a lot more sugar than there should be.

One thing I'm not sure about is whether I should be peeling the skins off of each bean. I've found online recipes saying that the skin should be removed, but others that say to leave it on. Looking at the pictures they appear de-skinned to me, but  when I make them without de-skinning its hard to spot the skins as they seem to turn translucent after simmering.

625,1706642263.0,"Low-temp cheesecake baking, combining sous-vide and a low-temp oven for a quicker result?","Hi all, I've been experimenting with cheesecake, since I don't want to make a cheesecake with a water bath, have a sous-vide set-up and like to experiment.

So my understanding of the food science behind baking a cheesecake is basically that the eggs need to set with temperature, and some acidic ingredients (eg lemon juice) help with setting due to low pH, though I do not know how strong the contribution of this effect is.

For the temperature, we need to reach 65*C (150F) for the eggs to coagulate, over a decent amount of time (https://www.seriouseats.com/sous-vide-101-all-about-eggs)

Based on this, I made a small batch of cheesecake batter, split it in 2 and sous-vide the stuff for 90 minutes, poured it over a graham-cracker base and let it set in the fridge for several hours. While the result tasted good, the consistency was unsurprisingly, not 'set' enough for me. When I looked closer, you could see small specks of coagulated eggs, even though the batter was mixed well.

Then, I found an old article stating you could bake a cheesecake overnight in the oven ([link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/food/1996/10/09/making-cheesecake-while-you-sleep/c22d857b-aac3-4156-a8df-54c81005b2d5/)), but that seems like a long time.

Therefore, the following idea: Can you combine the 2 steps - you make your batter, seal it in a bag and heat it till 55*C (130F), a temp where the eggs will never solidfy (serouss eat article above), then after, say an hour, you transfer it to a caketin and chuck it in an oven heated to 90 degrees C.
The reasoning is to get the batter with excellent consistency to a non-setting temperture, using the better heat-transfer of water (compared to air), then let the oven gently do the rest.

The idea is that I 'only' need to bake a large and tall cake for like 3 hrs instead of overnight.

Context:
I'm looking for the name of a dish I had when I was really young, it's simple but fairly distinct to me. So we used to go to this hole in the wall Italian restaurant in my small Massachusetts town. The restaurant was known in town for producing incredible Italian food with ingredients often imported from Italy. Most dinners we had there started with complimentary garlic bread prepared from a whole loaf of bread. It was great garlic bread, but my dad always passed on it and would yell to the owner/head chef (who barely spoke English) ""hey bring us some of those grumpies you're hiding back there!"". The owner then would procede to make a very specific appetizer that I only ever knew as grumpies. They didn't exist on his menu and I never could figure out what the hell the recipe was.

What I remember about the dish:
The ""grumpies"" were presented in a whicker basket with a cloth towel under them. It was made of bread and similar to garlic bread, unlike the garlic bread it was diced in cubes about twice as big as a sugar cube. The cubes were made from a very dense bread, not quite similar to the airy Italian style loaf it suplimented. The cubes where absolutely saturated in oil but possessed a slightly seared crust that seemed to hold all the excess oil inside. I liken the sensation of eating them to biting into a piece of apple. It had an initial crunch but soon after biting into it there was this juicy feeling of pure fat/oil layering over the tongue. The oil was savory like olive oil but not as strong tasting. The grumpies where surprisingly aromatic, it tasted slightly like garlic but what I remember most is the taste of fresh Italian seasonings (basil and oregano maybe?). Aside from the oil and bread, there wasn't much to the dish. Sometimes the chef would pair it with a few cuts of hard pungent Italian cheese (suspect it to be Romano)

649,1706557022.0,What's the point of a wok instead of a skillet on electric/induction stoves?,"Many people say you can stir fry with a wok on electric/induction, most reputably Kenji Lopez-Alt. Flat bottom wok, let it preheat a lot, small batches, no lifting, butane torch for wok hei, etc etc.  I'm wondering specifically why one would use a flat bottomed wok instead of a stainless or cast iron skillet.

The sides of a wok on electric/induction won't get hot enough to sear things on the sides, and the large size isn't needed if you have to use small batches of food. So what's the point? Can't I use a 12in skillet with high heat, small batches, and a butane torch, and get the exact same results? Similar threads on this sub haven't actually answered that.

That's not unusual, but at the end of the process, there were lots of collagen parts completely undissolved (though disconnected from the bone joints). 

My only guess as to why the collagen didn't melt is because it needed more time. Maybe an hour or two extra. I'm really not sure because, my memory might be failing me here, I recall 3 hours was good enough the last time.

Perhaps I made an error along the way, so here is my process as described below. Please feel free to educate me to improve my chicken stock recipe:

1. Quick boil frozen bones, drain
2. Roast them at 425 for 50 mins (I neglected to put them on a wire rack)
3. Give them a quick wash (I think I should skip this step, but the amount of floaties was horrible)
4. Put enough water in a pot to reach an inch above bones, Boil (so much trouble getting the right setting for simmering, I use electric stove)
5. After 2 hours, add veggies and more water to reach an inch above the new height
6. After 1 hour, scoop out pieces and run stock through a strainer before containing it.

693,1706394570.0,Inconsistent souffle pancakes,"I am a professional pastry chef and an item I have on my brunch menu is Japanese Souffle Pancakes. Base is made with cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, buttermilk, yolks, melted butter, and vanilla paste. We make the base, then fold in a French meringue made from egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar. The batter is poured into sprayed metal ring molds (filled halfway) and baked at 400F until they rise to the top and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. My team is just me and one assistant. We make over 2000 of these pancakes a year and they are very successful. HOWEVER over the two years that we have been in business we have found that maybe 2 or 3 weekends a year, our souffle pancakes stick to the ring molds and collapse immediately once we are able to release them with a thin knife. Usually, they release easily and cleanly from the molds without the need to use a knife at all. 

Any idea on what could be causing this? Here are the variables that we have attempted to control for:

\- clean egg whites

\- clean mixing bowls

\- clean ring molds that are thoroughly sprayed with Vegalene cooking spray

\- consistent brand of ingredients

\- properly scaled out ingredients

\- consistent method in making the meringue

\- oven temp

Clearly the addition of the cacao powder allowed the cookies to spread much more than the 'plain' ones - I doubt substituting white chocolate chips for the semi-sweet ones would have much influence on the final result.

This set is marked with a maker mark, so these are not some chinchy dollar store bowls; these are heavy-duty, probably made from some leftover WWII helmets (jk). Seriously though, my grandfather worked at a high school, and when the school got new stuff, staff got first pick of things they were replacing, so these might even be industrial grade from a school cafeteria. I dunno. Regardless, these are solid bowls. They didn't have a mark on them when my mother inherited them. After Mom passed, I got them, still no marks. Great, perfect, heavy-duty cookware. I use them. I am not a perfectionist, I am also not overly cautious because cookware is meant to be used, thus I am not super concerned with them getting banged up or scratched. That said, though I use them, I don't abuse them. These are my kitchen bowls, they are used for kitchen things. If I need bowls in my garage or shop, I have cheap ones I got at Walmart for that. But anyway, after having them for a few months, I started noticing deep, sharp dents in the bowls. Deep to the point, they are almost puncturing the bowls. At first, I thought I must have thrown something too hard in the bowl when it was in the sink. So, I made a concerted effort not to do that. It still kept happening. My next I thought was it must be happening in my dishwasher, force of the water with bowls banging against other dishes, et cetera. My dishwasher broke, and I have been hand washing for almost 2 years now, yet it still keeps happening. I understand the shallow dents. If it gets dropped they occur, but these deep dents are highly focused. To demonstrate how thick the steel is, to attempt to return these puncture dents (lack of a better term) in place, I have to use a hammer with a hard surface on the inside of the bowl. Almost all these puncture dents are from the inside of the bowl outward, they are all the same size, and look like someone tried punching a hole through the bowl using a nail or a punch. It is infuriating. I don't care about how my bowls look, I don't want my bowls damaged. I am married with no kids, and I do 90% of the cooking in my house, so it's not like someone else is doing something to my bowls they shouldn't. I asked my wife, and her response was, ""You know I don't cook, so obviously it's not me"", which, in this case, she is absolutely correct. I am down to whether there is a potential flaw in the manufacturing of the bowls that could be causing this, and if so, why in the 60 years of existence hasn't this occurred before?

I assume this is because the chemical properties of dark/milk chocolate are different from white chocolate such as white chocolate having more cocoa butter, different fat content etc. I was hoping someone could explain these differences from a food science perspective i.e. how chocolate and water makes a mousse (is it something to do with crystallization of chocolate similar to tempering it) and why with white chocolate water doesn't work. Is whipped cream simply used to compensate for missing fat which is for some reason necessary to make a mousse?

The Ramos Gin Fizz is a notorious cocktail for bartenders. The amount of labor involved makes this drink less widely popular. 

It requires a long dry shake with an egg white and whole milk. Following with an additional 3 minute shake with ice.

Next, two thirds of the drink is poured into a Collin‚Äôs glass while simultaneously adding club soda. Served without ice, you are left with a glass of a creamy cocktail with an extremely thick layer of foam. 

After it is made, you have the refrigerate the cocktail for  minutes. This stiffens the foam to prepare for the final step. 

Once stiffened, you use a straw to poke a hole through the top layer of foam. Then you pour the the liquid remnants from the shaker through the hole which causes the creamy foam to rise above the top of the glass. 


I have been experimenting with the drink for quite some time. Ideally, I am looking to make it vegetarian. 

I have successfully made it by swapping out the egg out for Mrs. Better‚Äôs, a foaming agent, and store bought dairy free whipping cream. 

I am looking to cut the amount of shaking required down, and amount of time required for it stiffen in the fridge. 

I have been reading about other foaming agents. I am looking for one that may provide foam in less time, and something to help the foam to stiffen?

797,1705955244.0,I'm cooking for 140 people this Thursday - send help !,"Hello everyone. About 2 years ago I started my journey of starting a burger joint. I believe in learning by making so I started gradually expanding the scope of my events. From birthday parties to other events, my latest event was also my biggest event with 70 guests. We do catering so we bring our big steel plancha and we cook outside fresh meat and hamburger bun. We do it smash-burger style, hence the big steel plancha. We managed to served our 70 guests in 1 hour and 15 minutes. 

Anyways, we recently got a great opportunity for an event of 140 people. Only issue was that they don't have a place to cook outside but they have a small kitchen. I spotted that they had 2 regular ovens and 2 microwave. I figured that we could prepare everything in advance and reheat that there. They also wanted to serve fries but with the limited material and big list of guests, I adviced to do roasted potatoes instead. 

I would like to explain you my plan and a few questions I have. Please tell me if you find something odd or unrealistic.

So, as I said there are 2 nice oven that have convection (Siemens). I calculated that I could fit in there 2 big hotel pans. They are 35cmx32cm and 10cm deep. I don't know if that makes sense from where you're from but in Belgium they are labeled as ""Bac gastronomique 2/3"". They all have a lid. I also bought a 32x53cmx15cm hotel pan that go into a water-bath (like double boiler) so the inside can stay nice and warm.

I plan on cooking all the meat beforehand, 2 patties for each burger like we always do. I will store them in the 2/3 hotel-pans I mentionned before. I should be able to store 45 portions in each hotel pan so 3 of them will be enough. I usually put cheese on both patties but this time I will only put cheese on the first layer (the cheese will then be ""in between"" the 2 patties) to make sure that the portions don't stick to each other. I will add the additional cheese slice during service, the heat from the burger should be enuogh. I'm really not concerned about those because I believe that I won't lose any quality, taste or texture by reheating them in a convection oven, lid on. 

For the buns, we will toast them in advance with a bit of butter on the plancha. Same thing as the burger meat, we will reheat them in the 2/3 hotel pan, but we'll only be able to put 27 buns in each. I will rehead them, convection, lid on, they'll be nice and warm. 

The potatoes are the ones that I'm the most worried about. The recipe I'm following is Kenji Lopez-alt's ([https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-roast-potatoes-ever-recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-roast-potatoes-ever-recipe)). It's a really lovely recipe and it's always good when I make them. Let me sum up the recipe : boil the potatoes until fork tender then rough em up in a bown with infused olive oil. Then it goes to the oven for about 2x20 minutes. The issue with these potatoes is that they are difficult to reheat. Even if you can spread them flat, you may loose too much humidity if you try and reach that same crispiness. It's even more difficult when you have to reheat a ton of them and they're on top of each other. At first I wanted to put them in my 2/3 hotel pans but realized it would maybe be better to put them in my water-bath reheater because a lukewarm potato is real bad ... I estimated that I should be able to put around 100 portions out of the 140 in the reheater. 

Do you have tips on how to reheat this amout of potatoes ? I know I won't get the same level of crispiness if any, so I've focused on having the perfect amount of salt in the water (25g of salt/liter) and a nice herb/garlic infused oil. But I'm worried the potatoes will get too soggy in a big hotel pan like that, and I'm also affraid the potatoes on the bottom will get squished. Maybe it's better to use the other pans and the convection oven ...

I've done a few tests and realised that it takes quite a lot of time to heat meat/potatoes from the fridge temperature to something like 40-50¬∞C. So I'm thinking about pre-reheating all the meat, potatoes before the service so I only need to pop them in the oven to gain those extra 10-20¬∞C, I guess I won't loose that much heat after I've pre-reheated them. I also realized reheating potatoes with the lid on is way quicked, but again I'm affraid it will get mushy with the extra steam. 

The general idea during service is that one of us will plate the buns, meat, sauce while the other asks the customer about what they would like as topping and will plate the potatoes. The one responsible for the buns/meats/sauce plating will also be responsible of making sure that everything is nice and hot, switching hotel pans, putting new ones in there etc. 

Sorry but the long text guys but I'm quite stressed out as it is a big opportunity for us and I believe that if we do a good job, it will lead to other events like that.

798,1705954828.0,My beans (and other legumes) always come out unevenly cooked,"I‚Äôm having trouble when cooking legumes.

On a whim I threw in some black truffle salt when seasoning the mix. After some time cooling, the pot pie mix started smelling very onion-y and has a pretty strong flavor in the funky realm of onions/garlic/shallots. This is from the black truffle salt, right?

I've never quite experienced the taste of black truffle as oniony, to me it's usually a more earthy/mushroom-y taste but this is my best guess on what happened after some retrospection.

803,1705936913.0,Ragu alla Bolognese Liquidiy,"I attempted to make the Ragu alla Bolognese recipe from the Accademia Italiana della Cucina. I used 80/20 ground beef for the main meat, and cooked everything in a relatively small Dutch oven. After browning the meat there was quite a bit of liquid in the dutch oven. I added the wine and got everything to the point of simmering the hours long period on low. After an hour I checked and it seemed very wet.

I _think_ the issue was too small of a pan as a) the meat seemed to be steaming after than browning, and b) the small pan didn't permit the liquid to evaporate.

When I watched Alex (frenchcookingguy) make the recipe, his looked much dryer at the point where he added the wine.

I also suspect the 20% fat resulted in more rendered fat in the pan than intended by the recipe.

Does my analysis of what went wrong sound correct? Any other suggestions? Thank you in advance. 

Here's the recipe:

* Coarsely ground beef (see note): 1 lb (400g) 
* Fresh pork pancetta, slices: 6 oz (150g) 
* ¬Ω onion, peeled: about 2 oz (60g) 
* 1 medium carrot, peeled: about 2 oz (60g) 
* 1 celery stalk, trimmed: about 2 oz (60g) 
* ¬Ω cup (1 glass) of red or white wine 
* Strained tomatoes: 7 oz (200g) 
* Tomato paste (double-concentrated): 1 tbsp 
* ¬Ω cup (1 glass) of whole milk (optional) 
* Light meat or vegetable broth (or stock cubes) 
* Extra virgin olive oil: 3 tbsp 
* Salt and pepper  

Preparation  

In a heavy non-stick 10-inch (24-26cm) casserole (aluminium or enamelled cast-iron (Dutch oven) or terracotta saucepans can be used), melt the ground or chopped pancetta with olive oil.  Using a chef‚Äôs or chopping knife, finely chop the onion, celery, and carrot (do not use a food processor); add the vegetables to the oil and pancetta and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until softened but not browned. Raise the heat to medium and add the meat, break it up, then cook for about ten minutes, always stirring, until it sizzles and browns. Add the wine; cook over medium heat until it has completely evaporated. Add the tomato paste and pur√©e. Mix well; add a cup of boiling stock (or water) and simmer, covered, for about 2 hours (or 3 depending on preference and type of meat), adding hot broth (or water) as needed. Add any milk (traditionally used) half way through the cooking; allow to evaporate completely. Season with salt and pepper before serving.

I'd like to understand better what we are trying to achieve at a ""molecular"" and structural level when frying rice.

Unfortunately since I really don't have a big picture here, I'll share what my thoughts are so far, and open the floor to you for other ideas.

With the day-old rice / microwave / use a fan to accelerate cooling technique. All three will reduce the hydration of the rice. The day-old rice MAY have some additional impact on starch structure (I believe this is the case with drying bread via letting it stale vs accelerating it in the oven).

Adding liquid ingredients. From watching a lot of videos, it looks like the liquids do some deglazing and some concentration. And if kept apart from the rice, the hydration impact on the rice can be managed.

Are we trying to reduce hydration on the rice so that it can uptake some concentrated water soluble flavors in the other stuff being tossed in?

In terms of my equipment bias: I have a stove that's hot enough to immediately reduce/evaporate any liquids added without having to pre-load the pan with much heat, but not hot enough to cook restaurant size portions. 2.5-3.6kW-induction

I‚Äôve made fresh wonton soup many times before, so I have a recipe/idea of what I would put in the broth. What I‚Äôm wondering is how I would go about *freezing* it. 

I was intending to make the whole soup (containing the broth, wontons, and bok choy) and then freeze the the portions in small soup containers.

So, to avoid ‚Äúcooking it twice‚Äù, I want to try to take the approach of the Authentic Asia brand soups - just freezing some sort of base for the flavour, and then layer the frozen wontons and bok choy on top, so I can add water and microwave for a quick meal or even just dump it in a pot and boil it. 

Any advice or other alternatives to freezing the whole portion after cooking?

- a tsp of better than bouillon chicken stock paste 
- tsp light soya sauce 
- tsp minced garlic and ginger 
- tsp sesame oil

Well, I was considering buying another and ended up looking more into the brand and realised that while they claim to be German I could find absolutely nothing when searching for the brand in German. All listings seem to be from Amazon (for the Dutch oven at least) and the social media pages are all in English. Additionally, when you go on the Michelangelo storefront on Amazon and click on the 'More' tab in the menu, the pop-up window will say 'Go back' above other options, but also include 2 Chinese characters (I presume, I don't actually know what language they are so I don't mean any disrespect!)

The pot itself comes with a little leaflet that talks about the brand in the way all brands like to talk about themselves if they've been established through longstanding tradition. There is nothing to make me think it might not be German apart from the fact that it doesn't seem to really exist in Germany. 

&#x200B;

It's not so much about whether or not the pot is German, it's the concern that maybe the listing included a rather elaborate lie which would make me a bit worried about the true materials of the pot. I bought it because I wanted non-toxic cookware and I would really like to have certainty about that.

We have found that our rules help our sub stay focused. Generalized subs are great for general discussion, but we're trying to preserve a little bit of a unique identity, and our rules are our best effort to do that. This thread is the space to discuss our rules, or please feel free to message the mods. Please let us know how you think we can make [r/askculinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/askculinary) better. We don't claim to be perfect. We're trying to make a positive, helpful community.

POSTING:

We're best at:

Troubleshooting dishes/menus

Equipment troubleshooting questions (not brand requests)

Technique questions

Food science

Please Keep Questions:

Specific (Have a goal in mind!)

Detailed (Include the recipe, pictures, etc.)

On topic

This will ensure you get the best answers.

Here's how to help us help you:

PROVIDE AS MUCH INFO AS YOU CAN. We can't help you if you don't tell us what you've already done first. Please provide the recipe you're working from and tell us what went wrong with it or what you'd like to improve about it. ""I've tried everything"" isn't specific enough. If you're following a video recipe, consider putting a timestamp at the relevant portion of the video or writing out the recipe in text form.

NO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OF FOOD SAFETY. Food safety is one area where we cannot and will not answer a specific question, because we can't tell you anything about the specific pot of soup you left out overnight, and whether it is safe to eat. We will tell you about food safety best practices, but we only want answers from people actual knowledge. ""I've always done \[thing\] and I'm still OK"" is not an acceptable answer, for the same reason ""I never wear a seatbelt and I'm still here"" is not an acceptable answer. For specific situations we recommend you consult government food safety guidelines for your area and when in doubt, throw it out.

NO RECIPE REQUESTS. If you have a recipe you'd like help adjusting or troubleshooting, we'd love to help you! But [r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) is not in the business of providing recipes. There are tons of other subreddits that can help you with that.

NO BRAINSTORMING OR GENERAL DISCUSSION. We do make exceptions for mass quantities and unusual ingredients (real past examples: wheelbarrow full of walnuts; nearly 400 ounces of canned tuna; 50 lbs of whole chicken), but ""What do I do with my last three limes?"" or ""What should I serve with this pork loin?"" should go to [r/Cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking). Community discussions are reserved for our weekly stickied posts. If you have a discussion question that you think people would find interesting or engaging, please send a modmail so we can add it to our list of discussion questions.

NO BRAND RECOMMENDATIONS or ""What piece of equipment should I get?"" posts. It's very rare that one person has enough experience with multiple brands or models of a particular item to provide an objective response. We suggest you consult sources like Consumer Reports, the wirecutter, Serious Eats, or the like.

NO SURVEYS.

NO SELF-PROMOTION OR CONTENT LINKS.

COMMENTING:

BE NICE TO EACH OTHER. Politeness is not optional at [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary). We're all here to help each other learn new things and succeed in the kitchen.

TOP LEVEL COMMENTS MUST ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. Saying ""oh hey, I always wondered that too!"" or ""try it and let us know!"" doesn't help OP. Comments asking for more information and comments made in good faith that don't directly address OP's exact question but provide an alternate solution are OK.

NO LINKS WITHOUT EXPLANATION. The reason people come to [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) is because the people who answer questions here are real people with real kitchen advice. If you find a good source that answers OP's question, please provide it! But also provide at least a little bit of extra information so OP knows what they're clicking on and what to expect.

STAY ON SUBJECT. Posts here present questions to be answered, not prompts for a general subjects of discussion. If a post does spark a question for you, please ask it in a separate post (in [r/Cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking) or a specialty sub if it doesn't fit the requirements above). Likewise, no jokes: we're trying to be helpful. To that end, when a post has been answered and turns into general discussion about other stuff, we lock those threads.

FAQs: See our Ingredient, Equipment, and Food Life FAQs to find answers on common topics like caring for cast iron and whether you should go to culinary school or not. If you'd like to contribute to the FAQs, we'd love to have your help.

FLAIR: For those of you who have been around for a little, please message the mods to apply for flair. Our requirement is a history of positive engagement with the sub, but amateurs are just as welcome to flair as are professionals.

Please use the report button to let moderators know about posts or comments that violate one of the above rules! We spend a lot of time here but we can't catch everything on our own. We depend on you guys to help us keep bots, antagonistic weirdos, and habitual rule-breakers away.",AskCulinary

The bread is sold with the wraps and other non-refrigerated bread. It comes in a plastic bag, twisted at the top with a typical plastic bread clip to keep it closed.  
Since garlic can cause botulism in certain situations, is it possible to get botulism from this type of bread? Shouldn't it be sold refrigerated? Would there be enough oxygen in the enclosed bag to prevent botulism growth?   
I know it is likely safe, otherwise it could not be sold this way, but I'm trying to understand \*why\* it's safe. From what I'm reading online, it sounds like chopped garlic shouldn't be kept at room temperature. Thanks!

It is a large diameter cut, too large to be a tenderloin cut.  It is somewhat shaped like a NY strip, but the texture is too soft and the price is too low. and it is a little thicker than usual.  Also, why add 'boneless' on the label -- filets and ny strips aren't usually labelled boneless?

895,1705595234.0,Chicken broth question.,"I'm planning on making coq a van sometime in the next two weeks or so.  Normally, when I cook a giant hunk of meat with lots of bones, I spend the following day making broth from the bones.  I have every intention of doing that, with the carcass from the coq a van.

However, I'm curious about whether or not the broth is going to turn out very different than what I'm accustomed to.  This chicken is going to be marinated in wine overnight, and then cooked in that same wine.  My gut says that's going to get into the bones in some way, and ultimately have an affect on the broth that comes from said bones.  But I've never done this, so I don't know.

I'm going to try it out, and see for myself.   But, in the meantime, I'm asking here so I can maybe start to plan ahead some ways to use this potentially niche broth.

So...

Is this going to be totally normal broth, that I can freeze and forget about, and use whenever for whatever?  Or is it going to have some distinctive wine funk to it, that only makes it suitable for certain applications?   (And if so, what kind of applications might you suggest?)",AskCulinary

898,1705561430.0,Recipe for Restaurant-Style Teriyaki Chicken?,"Tonight I tried to make some basic chicken teriyaki takeout but ran into some issues I‚Äôd like to iron out.

To achieve what my local teriyaki restaurant does, it seems they marinate their chicken in teriyaki as expected, but then they also pour some over it while grilling it. Then even more is added when serving - the grilled chicken is put on a bed of rice and then teriyaki sauce is drizzled on it. It soaks into the rice as well - the result is amazing strong teriyaki flavor and it feels very cohesive.

Their sauce is more sweet than salty I‚Äôd say, and overall pretty subtle which is why they can use it at 3 different times when preparing their chicken teriyaki.

I grabbed some Yoshida‚Äôs and marinated some cut up boneless chicken thighs in it for about an hour. I decided the sauce was too salty/strong to pour directly over the top of the finished result, and also a bit too runny.

I cooked the chicken in the air fryer and I thought it did cook nicely, but I could hardly taste any teriyaki when all was said and done.

So my questions are: how do I turn yoshida‚Äôs into a sauce that I can pour over the chicken and rice? I feel like I may need to add cornstarch, water, maybe a bit of brown sugar? How do I develop stronger teriyaki flavor in general? Do I need to change my whole approach?",AskCulinary

A single batch calls for just a couple eggs, with the yolks and the whites processed separately. Would it be possible to beat the yolks with sugar in a double boiler to temp (165¬∞F I'm guessing), and then separately whip the egg whites over a double boiler to the same temp? 

Come to think of it, can egg whites even reach stiff peaks over heat like that? Would I even be able to cook the full volume of egg whites to a safe temp, or would just the stuff in the bottom of the double boiler bowl reach the right temperature and the stuff on top wouldn't?

No stores near me carry pasteurized eggs, and I don't know anyone with a sous vide. I can't afford a sous vide of my own just yet.

I've been seeing online you can make heavy cream into butter by blending the life out of it. Every recipe says the same thing:

\- It's simple

\- You blend on medium-high for 5-10 min, then low while scraping sides and it will form chunks

\- then, strain the water out and you're good to go

So, that's exactly what I did. The first go-round i put 2 cups with 1/2tsp salt, and blended it for like 20 odd minutes to no success \[edit, yes, I checked every couple mins\]. I checked and it was just very warm cream.

&#x200B;

Looked online and it said the  fat % and temperature are crucial. I looked it up and heavy cream in the US is FDA regulated to be no less than 36%, so it should be good there. I threw it in the freezer to quickly chill it.

Second attempt was more successful‚ÄîI got a sort of salty whipped cream. It was closer to creme fraiche than anything. No water came out, so I figured this wasn't butter. After a couple tries on low speed afterwards, the nonsense turned back into homogenized cream.

And a smaller slow cooker for smaller portions (6 or 8 qt, e.g. over night oats), which I also need to replace. Wondering if there's a better equipment combo to give us the back-counter cooking performance we need.

 I'm considering a 10"" or 12"" induction burner (or would a simple cast iron hot plate be better?), and replacing the small slow cooker as is. Issues with this:

1. Can't set a temperature (simmer) that will be consistent with evaporation, may not be safe to leave over night?
2. Pots will still evaporate a lot (could weight the lid or get a pressure cooker pot to put on the burner?
3. Height to width ratio would be challenging for some braises, and turkey

Other suggestions?!

919,1705500306.0,Help with liangfen,"I recently had some of these at a Sichuan restaurant near me and I loved them. I decided to make them at home and I got really close but the noodles turned out less than ideal. Instead of being jelly-like all the way through, they felt starchy when eaten, almost 'grainy'. I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong? The mixture set up really well in the dish and was jelly-esque and pliable when I handled it, but once the noodle broke, it was a bit of a mess.

I used [this recipe](https://woonheng.com/liang-fen-cold-jelly-noodles/). Initially, I tried with medium low heat and it took a very, very long time. I took them out too early and tried chilling them but I could tell that it wasn't right so I returned them to the pan and cooked the starch until it was translucent. Then I put them back in the dish to cool and put them in the fridge.

I'm wondering if one of the following is the culprit:

* I didn't heat the mung bean starch/water mixture enough in total
* Taking it off the heat too early and then returning it to the pan
* Chilling it in the fridge instead of letting it cool on the counter

UPDATE: I tried the noodles the same day I made them after they had been in the fridge for about an hour. I only used about half the recipe. Even though I was disappointed with the result, I put the remaining noodles in the fridge. Today, I took a look at them and noticed a few things:

* The noodles had let out a significant amount of liquid while in the fridge over night
* The texture was *much* better than when I tried them the first time.

I think that, maybe, I got there in the end with the recipe I used but I didn't let them fully cool down and become fully gelatinous. That being said, I do think that I will try again and make sure to integrate the starch and water fully and let it heat through to translucent and fully incorporated. I'll also probably make these a day ahead so that they have plenty of time to set up and acquire the right texture.

Usually I get cheap olive oil with a screw-on cap, but I just ordered a fancy bottle from overseas, and it has a top that sticks down into the bottle neck, like a cork.  The top is made of plastic, though.  The bottle arrived today, frozen solid (there's been a major cold snap in my area).  I read online that all you have to do in that case is put the bottle in a room-temperature place out of the sun and it will thaw.  I did that, and by evening the oil in the bottle had returned to a liquid state, so I went to open it.  

I peeled off the wrapper sealing the top and the ""cork"" part exploded out of it like a champagne cork, so hard it hit my ceiling.  I've retrieved it, washed it and put it back, but it kind of shocked me, because I didn't think that would happen with a non-carbonated substance.  It this normal?

I'vetried to recreate it for years, and have scoured every Chile con Queso recipe I could find, and have never been successful.  

**Ingredients**:  
* Shredded cheddar  
* Stale/flat beer  
* Sliced fresh jalapenos  
* Worcestershire sauce  
* Tabasco sauce  
* Coleman's mustard powder  

**Method**: From my recollection, she heated up the equivalent of a double-boiler, put in all the ingredients save the cheese and once that was warm, added the cheese. Regularly stirring, of course.  

**Issue**: I've tried to recreate the recipe and it never comes out right. The cheese doesn't melt right, and ends up stringy and gloopy. I though using sodium citrate might help, but it's almost too smooth, if that makes sense. The dish I loved wasn't stringy but had melted parts and, maybe, grainy parts that made you know you were eating cheddar.

956,1705370810.0,Why my Mexican rice is burnt on the bottom of the pan?,"Here is my recipe:

1. on a mid-low heat stove fry 1 cup Mexican rice (middle grain) and 2 garlics in some oil
2. once rice is light brown, add 1 Roma tomato and 1/2 onion cubed
3. once tomato is midway cooked, add 1 tomato sauce box (\~7oz) and stir into rice
4. after a minute or two that the sauce is cooking, add 2 cups of warm water
5. mix and salt/pepper/bouillon to taste
6. once it starts to boil lower to lowest temp settings and cover
7. cook 20 minutes, turn off heat and don't open pot for at least 10 minutes

Rice is fluffy not pasty and its cooked well, it doesn't clump together, however, I always have burnt rice on the bottom of the pan, what should I do? the heat is in the minimum possible, I have tried to cook it 10, 15 minutes (instead of 20) and it is not cooked all the way thru

Should I try 18 minutes and so forth? more water?

Thanks!",AskCulinary
957,1705370351.0,What is the name of this recipe???,"Hello all. My family has cooked this since I was a little kid but no one knows the name of the dish!! I‚Äôll describe it below. My great grandma used to call it little hotdog. 

Saut√© white onions and bell peppers in olive oil, along with a package of lingui√ßa. 

Deglaze with a cup of white wine. We usually used Pinot Grigio. Not sure if that‚Äôs the correct wine. 

Add a can of tomato sauce, along with two chicken thighs or breasts chopped into 1-2inch pieces. 

Cook it all together until the chicken is done and serve it atop white rice


The closest thing I‚Äôve found was a Cape Verdean dish, but it leaves out the chicken. It‚Äôs possible that was an adaptation but my mom said she remembers when she was a child it had a name but she couldn‚Äôt pronounce it, so that‚Äôs why they‚Äôd call it little hot dog.",AskCulinary

959,1705369367.0,trader joes blondies,"hi all, made TJ blondies in a 4x8 pan (banana bread) instead of the recommended 8x8. Bake at 350 28-32min, but the middle was still mushy even after 36ish min, but rim was golden and crispy.  Note that I also added strawberries to it. yum! I am learning to bake and the nuances of temp and WxL and amount in the oven. 

How long should I have baked 4x8 for so that it would be properly baked? Does it work still? Why does it bake at different times? Any rule of thumb for this?",AskCulinary
960,1705368253.0,Failed bordelaise,"Wanted to do a bordelaise for a while, finally did it this weekend as follows (roughly following Julia Child and other online videos):

- beef stock from scratch with about 6 pounds of beef neck bones and marrow bones, simmered about 6 hours (roasted the bones in oven prior to adding to stock)
- took a quart of the stock and reduced by about half, trying to make a demi glace
- reduced about 1/3 bottle of red wine with shallot; added the pseudo demi glace, simmered for an hour or so
- added in cooked bone marrow and about 2-3 tbspn cold diced butter at the end

The sauce was super greasy, never really emulsified. May have been an issue with the stock not having enough collagen in it? The stock never jellied/solidified like my chicken stock has in the past. Should I use more beef bones next time?",AskCulinary

All the recipes online say that this will only last for a few days or a week at most without refrigeration.

965,1705359427.0,Freeze cooked chuck roast?,"Basically I had a 5 pound chuck roast that I had frozen a few months ago, thawed it out in expecting a group of people to come over for dinner, and realized that with the snow we've had here (which is not a lot but people in Maryland are terrified to drive in over an inch of snow), that it was either going to go bad or I had to just cooked it.

So, I cooked it in two 2.5 pound chunks, the idea being that I will use one half for dinner for us tonight (and tomorrow), and I'll let the other one get to room temp, vaccum seal, and then re-freeze, with the intention of using it again in a few weeks when we will eat it.

It should be fine, right? I know you shouldn't re-freeze raw meat, but freezing cooked meat should still work?",AskCulinary
