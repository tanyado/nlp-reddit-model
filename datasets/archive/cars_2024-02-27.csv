Analysts think ICE (internal combustion engine) car makers are in for a rude shock, as EV prices come in below existing petrol and diesel models at the lower end of the market.

“EVs will soon be cheaper than ICE vehicles in the lower mainstream automotive market.” says Vision Mobility consultant James Carter.

“Why? Because key minerals needed for LFP battery production are cheap: Lithium, iron, aluminum, graphite and copper. None are rare, all are commodity items and easily sourced from ethical supply sources. Even the lithium is cheaper as it uses lithium carbonate, rather than lithium hydroxide.”

I recently bought a brand new car. Every car I've owned before was used because I didn't feel that getting new was worth, but the new car is a WRX and I don't trust used performance vehicles.

I want to perform some maintenance on it on my own and log it properly. What I want to do is have a binder with inserts. When I do maintenance on my own (e.g. an oil change) I'd have a single page where I could input the mileage, maintenance done, products used, and staple the receipts. Stick it in an insert and that's one maintenance. Similar to what the dealership or another garage would give you as a record. I'd do the same with dealer-performed maintenances - put the record they provide in their own inserts with the provided receipts.

Now, the problem is every printable car maintenance log template I can find, whether free or for sale or pre-printed are all basically multi-row spreadsheets for a zillion maintenances per page. Not enough room for proper notes and don't help with organizing receipts obviously since they'd all be in a jumble together.

I've pondered designing my own but before I do that I'd like to see if any of you guys know of a useful single-event maintenance log.

Thanks!",cars
18,1708970852.0,I rented the winner of Car and Driver’s 2024 Three-Row SUV Throwdown (2024 Mazda CX-90),"[Link](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparison-test/a44937256/2023-honda-pilot-2023-jeep-grand-cherokee-l-2023-kia-telluride-2024-mazda-cx-90-2024-toyota-grand-highlander-comparison-test/) to the Car and Driver article.

# Preface

After an 11 month, problem-ridden ownership experience with a CPO 21 VW Arteon, S.O. decided to dump it and find something else. We’ve been test driving a ton of cars for several months, but only 2 made the cut. The previous and current generation Genesis G80.

We found a 19 G80 Sport 3.3T with 47k miles north of Indianapolis and decided to make the trip down to check it out. My vehicle is close to needing an oil change, so we opted to get a rental.

The CX-90 was the first thing I noticed on the National lot when we arrived. After test driving one several months ago, I liked it but wished to spend more time with it to solidify my thoughts. Seeing nothing else intriguing, we hopped in and checked out.

# Specs

**Year/Make/Model:** 2024 Mazda CX-90  
**Trim:** Turbo Premium  
**Horsepower:** 280 HP  
**Torque:** 332 lb-ft  
**Odometer:** 7425 Miles  
**Photos:** [Link](https://imgur.com/a/N8FhiIL)

# The Good

**Engine:** The base inline 6 engine making 280 HP and 332 lb-ft of torque moves the vehicle smoothly and effortlessly. Max torque is available at 2000 RPM so the vehicle feels very responsive off the line. If I had to complain, it runs out of steam at the top end. But how often are you really wringing out your 3-row family-mobile?

**Driving Feel:** This has to be the most enjoyable driving experience in a 3-row SUV that I've had in recent memory. Most reviewers have already talked about this ad nauseam so I'll defer to them. It's the Mazda of the 3-row SUV's -- what's more to say?

**Build Quality:** There weren't a ton of miles on the vehicle when I grabbed the keys. But even so, I didn't notice any persistent creaks or rattles. I wish I could say the same for my K5, which is currently at 4600 miles.

​**Fuel Economy:** We averaged 28.5 mpg over our 742 mile trip.

**Audio System:** This is the first Bose system that I’ve actually liked. To get it to sound good to my ears, I turned off CenterPoint and adjusted the treble and bass down slightly. After doing this, vocals sounded clear without being shrill and bass was prominent but controlled.

**Engine Start Stop (i-stop):** Most people hate start-stop systems, but I've grown to appreciate them knowing that one of my friends works on this function for a large manufacturer. The CX-90 employs rolling start-stop, which shuts the engine off well before the vehicle has come to a complete stop. Most of the time, I didn't even realize the engine had shut off until after I released the brake. Starts are also quick, quiet, and smooth.

I think the coolest thing about this system is that it's able to shut down the engine when coasting at higher speeds. I didn't realize this was possible until I rented an A3 that did the same. This probably aids the CX-90 to achieve such high fuel economy figures relative to its size. This coasting start-stop  worked very well overall. Occasionally, I felt a bit of drag when the powertrain came back online, but it was very minor.

# The Bad

**Seats:** Mazda seats have always been a miss for me. With the CX-90, I initially thought that they made a big step forward -- that is... until hour 2 of the trip. The driver seat has 8-way power, but no matter how I adjusted, I couldn't find a perfect position. I feel like you have to have absolute perfect posture to ~~be comfortable~~ not be in pain.

Leaning over to rest my elbow on the center arm rest? -- Back pain.  
Resting knee on side of center console? -- Lower thigh pain.  
Sliding forward to relieve lower thigh pressure? -- Back pain.

At 28 years old, 5'6"", and average weight, I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this level of discomfort. I imagine this will be worse for older people or people with back issues.

**Lane Keep Assist System:** This is the crudest form of Lane Keep Assist that I've seen in a new vehicle. When departing the lane, the LKAS will aggressively veer the vehicle back into the lane to the point where you start to depart the lane on the other side. LKAS will again aggressively veer the vehicle to the other side. At this point, the vehicle is approximately 30 degrees off-center and LKAS just throws its hands up and gives up. Terrible.

**Backup Camera:** The [standard backup camera](https://i.imgur.com/XX7uapp.jpg) on this $45,900 vehicle has no dynamic guidelines. Keep in mind that pricing was recently reduced to match the CX-70. Whoever approved this deserves jail.

**Cup Holders:** The [cup holders](https://i.imgur.com/eS17wSf.jpg) are barely large enough to fit my 16 oz AutoSeal Contigo. S.O.'s 32 oz Thermoflask water bottle was left rolling around in the second row since we couldn't find any other place for it. It's ridiculous that the digi-shifter takes up more space than what they allocated for the cup holders.

**Ride Quality:** Suspension tuning is stiff to provide more body control. While not jarring, driving over broken pavement can be uncomfortable. Additionally, most road imperfections are noticeable from within the cabin.

# Annoyances

**Transmission:** The tuning has improved since I last test drove a CX-90, which was close to its release. At the time, the transmission was extremely jerky and unpredictable. During the test drive, I tried to make a pass. I hit the gas, the revs rose, but nothing happened until 2 seconds later when the vehicle essentially dumped the clutch. I honestly thought something broke.

During this trip, the transmission was much better behaved. It was quick to downshift and most shifts were imperceptible. However, it still could be jerky during low speed driving.

**Door Handle Placement:** I'm not sure why but every time I tried to open the door from inside, I would instinctively try clawing at [this plastic piece](https://i.imgur.com/jzdQ94B.jpg) whereas the actual handle is located lower on the door card. I thought it was just me, but S.O. did the same.

**Tires:** The stock Toyo Open Country A50 can be quite loud depending on pavement type.

# Conclusion

I enjoyed my short time with the CX-90. I think it's the most fun to drive 3-row SUV at its price point. However, in achieving this, I think Mazda lost sight of what buyers in this class of vehicle are looking for. Uncomfortable seats for long trips, stiff ride, bad safety tech, and poor storage are going to be deal breakers for most people. It's a great vehicle... just not a very good family vehicle.",cars

22,1708964390.0,Oil Change Interval Myth,"This should generate a heated discussion. I am by no means an expert, but I was surprised by this Blackstone Lab podcast #105 about how full synthetic oil practically never breaks down. They tested an old opened bottle of Mobil 1 5W/30 on the shelf that was 13 years old. They contacted Mobil and they were quoted to say the oil breaks down overtime and loses its effectiveness. Mobile reps would not give any details as to WHY it wouldn't be recommended.

Blackstone continued to test the oil in their labs. Viscosity has not changed. No water content. Appropriate flashpoint. No traces of insolubles. TBN and TAN that was perfect / standard. Based on the analysis suggests that that bottle of oil is perfectly good to use in a car right now.

The second part is oil that actually sits in a car engine in a modern engine for a period of time. Modern engine is 80's and onward. No open breather that would allow moisture, so it would not introduce moisture into the system, unless you have a coolant leak. 

First test was 2020 Ford F150 for oil in the car for 6 months, for the drivers who worry about 6 month longevity. The oil was still good for another 2,000 miles.

Second test. 2017 Wrangler. 2 year old oil, 5000 miles. Oil was still good.

Third test. 2000 F350. 2 year old oil. Oil was still good.

Fourth test. 1997 Towncar. 5 year inactivity oil. Unkown miles. Oil showed normal wear but no unusual breakdown that would suggest time based reasons.

Fifth test. 1984 F250. 6 year inactivity oil. Same wear of steel parts in the oil, but again, normal physical properties of the oil itself.

Last test. Mobile 1 10W40 in a 1995 Porsche 993. 10 years old, 760 miles. Oil was in perfect condition.

To summarize, time alone is NO reason that full synthetic oil would be unusable. Of course there are many other factors. He says it's a misconception that oil breaks down over time. Miles are what you have to keep track on.

This really changed what I believe in oil life in a low mileage car, compared to everyone who demands an oil change at least once a year. So many posts on the internet stating what the manufacturer recommends and not how the actual product holds up in lab analysis. I absolutely do not argue against the mantra of ""it's cheaper to change the oil than the engine."", however this post isn't to argue about the cost of frequent oil changes, but to address the myth of time based oil breakdown. 

Let me know what you think!

I’d say these were the most infamous in my opinion

-The VAG Dieselgate scandal, which was the final nail in the coffin for mass production of diesel powered cars in the States.

There’s also the Cumminsgate scandal as of recently, but I think Dieselgate was far worse, since it was a worldwide scandal

-That one scandal where Ford was in a lawsuit where they refused to recall the Pinto because of its fuel tank placement, which in a rear end collision, may get punctured and end up immolating the car.

If I’m correct, Ford lost more money in the lawsuit than they would’ve lost in recalling and solving the issue (which I believe cost only 11 dollar/car)

-There was also the DC scandal in India, where famous (or rather infamous) car designer Dilip Chhabria, also known as DC, was arrested for registering multiple models of the DC Avanti, a sports car he designed and manufactured, under the same engine and chassis number

It was also claimed that his company had taken multiple loans (around 42 lakh rupees per car, which was 50k USD) by posing as customers of said cars, and around 90 of the 120 models sold were financed in this manner.",cars

58,1708730070.0,"What sports cars have you driven, and what did you think about them + quick review of my few","I'm no rich or wealthy person but I would like to think I drove at least somewhat special vehicles in my life but I like / have driven all US made vehicles along the list of:   
2016 c7 corvette z06 (stock)   
2020 Camaro zl1 1le (stock)   
2018 c7 grand sport (FBO / modified but still NA)   
2015 Mustang GT (1000hp supercharged, e85, etc... heavily modified)   


Pros/Cons:   


  
C7 platform:   
\+Sexy (most attractive car out of the bunch, and imo better looking than the c8)  
\-grip in corners and just in general was not that great, car felt like it just didn't want to stay planted and not very confidence-building in general 

\+ had the ""exotic"" vibe + top came off so was great to take the wife for fancy things or beach trips

\-felt like I needed to clench my butt-cheeks over every single bump and speedbumps were my worst enemy 

\+felt like you were driving a super car without paying 250k+   


Zl1 1le: 

\+ Favorite car out of the bunch for pure driving experience, car was very confidence inspiring around corners and the chassis + suspension just felt way better than the corvette 

\-somehow the zl1 1le inspired all the camaro owners to start putting wings and diveplanes on their cars which kind of took away the ""uniqueness"" of the zl1 1le to me 

\+nobody really knew what it was, they just thought it was a camaro with some aftermarket bodykit which I enjoyed

\-still has the ""not a corvette"" comments and you get lumped in with the ""muscle car"" crowd even though that's not necessarily what it is 

\+felt like the best balance between ""raw"" factor and ""finesse"" in terms of drivability, just felt ""special"" in a way I can't describe  


s550 Mustang: 

\+no cats or resonators/mufflers so it catches eyes (but mostly ears) wherever I go

\-zero grip unless its hot and sticky outside, and can only go fast in a straight line 

\+definitely an ego-stroker knowing you can beat super cars (as long as you get traction) or 99.99% of any car on the road, and made me appreciate the engineering it takes for road-course cars to go fast and not just ""just slap more power on it bro"" cars 

\-Looks just like a regular mustang really 

\+the most uncontrollable and batshit insane vehicle i've ever driven   


  
If anyone has any adding comments, feel free! But I am also curious what kinds of cars everyone else has driven/owned and what they thought about them as well. ",cars

61,1708709044.0,AMA: Car and Driver Lightning Lap 2024. Ask away,"Hi, I’m K.C. Colwell, executive editor of Car and Driver and one of the drivers at our annual Lightning Lap track test. Every year we put the hottest new performance cars through the ultimate test: lapping Virginia International Raceway’s 4.1-mile Grand Course, a track we consider the toughest in the U.S. It was a good year, and we'll have all the details in our March/April issue and on the website.  
This is the 17th Lightning Lap, and our all-time leaderboard is now 327 production cars deep. But this year we invited more than just production cars. Subaru Motorsports brought out Airslayer with legendary driver Scott Speed at the wheel. Built by Vermont SportsCar, Airslayer amounts to an uncorked rallycross car. It’s got a real Can-Am vibe. Porsche racer Patrick Long lapped a 911 GT3 RS on the Full Course to see how it compares with the current 911 race car. And somehow, we convinced Hendrick Motorsports to bring its Garage 56 NASCAR Camaro out and to agree to let us drive it. But not for time. IMSA veteran and G56 development driver Jordan Taylor did the lapping at speed. And before you ask, yes, it is every bit as awesome as it looked and sounded at Le Mans last June.  
We also answered the question, is two better than four? As in: car versus motorcycle. BMW factory rider Nate Kern brought a BMW M 1000RR out to VIR. He’s raced at VIR a bunch, but he’s never tackled Grand. The stories don’t go live until 2/22 at 9:00 AM ET, but once they are, you can find them at https://www.caranddriver.com.  
I’m joined by the other drivers from this year’s event: Dave Beard (u/nameonface), Tony Quiroga, Dan Edmunds (u/suspensiontuna), and Dave VanderWerp (u/dave2979), as well as Carlos Lago (u/clago), who put together all the videos from this year’s event. On 2/23 starting at 9:00 AM, we’ll be answering any questions you have about this year’s cars and laps, and Lightning Lap in general. AMA!

[Ultra Warmonger 6 Anthracite Wheels](https://www.ultrawheel.com/wheel/126-warmonger-6-gloss-anthracite-with-gloss-black-lip-and-clear-coat-20x9-6-lug/15280/4890/6/?view=4)

[Vossen HFX-1 Gun Metal](https://vossenwheels.com/wheels/)

&#x200B;

Any thoughts on the Ultra wheels? I like the Vossen's looks the most, but my budget isn't unlimited, if I do $650 a piece, thats near $3000 vs $1000 with Ultra or Roush. The Roush I don't like all that much, but I figure they are basically OEM equivalent, is that reasonable?",cars
63,1708705613.0,I can’t help but wonder where would Nissan be if Carlos Ghosn was still in leadership of Nissan,"Despite efforts of Nissan to try to reinvent the brand and releasing more modern and competitive products, they’ve lost much market share in almost all of their markets (especially China) since Carlos has left. They sold almost 5.8 million vehicles globally in 2018 and even with more competitive products now, they’re now selling 2 million vehicles yet and global revenue is $30 Billion dollars less. In 2017, Nissan-Renault was the world’s auto largest manufacturer, overtaking Toyota and Volkswagen. They’re now a comfortable #6, behind Hyundai/Kia, Stellantis and GM.

Despite Carlos cost cutting the company to hell, his formula saved the company and sales and revenue was most under his leadership. He lead the industry with the Leaf, revived the 350Z, is responsible for the R35 GT-R, and Infiniti arguably was BMW’s biggest competitor under his leadership, which Nissan couldn’t care less about now. It speaks volume that both Ford and GM wanted him to leave Nissan to save them during the recession in 2009.

That’s not to say that he was all peaches and cream because he was also responsible for the defective Jatco CVT’s that they refused to remove and/or address, he left ancient products around as long as possible, cost cut the company to hell and they financed (still do) anyone with legs. 

What are your thoughts? Do you think Nissan would be in a better or worse position than it is now? Do you think they’d be ahead in the electrification race and would products be more or less competitive?

> Equipped exclusively with the i-FORCE MAX hybrid powertrain producing 326 hp, 465 lb.-ft. of torque

> Full-time four-wheel drive with center- and rear-locking differentials

> Land Cruiser has received an EPA-estimated **23 MPG** combined rating which is a higher combined MPG rating than any previous iteration.

>  Another new addition to Land Cruiser is the available front stabilizer bar disconnect mechanism (SDM), which increases suspension flex with the push of a button. With the front stabilizer bar disconnected, articulation increases significantly helping the front tires to stay in contact with the ground.

122,1708375245.0,Throttle House(Thomas) review of the 2024 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness(Text based from their Instagram).,"Thomas from Throttle House posted a text based review of the 2024 Subaru Crosstrek Wilderness that he had for a week on the official Throttle House instagram account.

""For years now, Mr. Jason Fenske has been ironically lauding the Subaru Crosstrek as God’s gift to man.

Jesus himself drove one apparently.

I always chuckled, and rolled my eyes. “What a goofball” I would say. His insistence on its superiority to everything has been a happy source of hyperbolic humour for a long time. Because well, of course it isn’t.

But then I had the opportunity to spend a week with the 2024 Crosstrek Wilderness.

Spoiler alert: I loved it.

The last Crosstrek I drove was a few years back. Before they plopped the optional 182 HP 2.5L Boxer-4 into it. With the base 2.0 I always thought the car was so slow, it was at risk of being overtaken by the nearest glacier.

But the 2.5 that comes in the Wilderness trim was everything I needed. Even if the CVT attached to it was a bit droney sometimes.

So with power sorted, I realized I was driving around in a spacious AWD hatch, that was the very definition of “get in and go.” Everything was simple and intuitive.

Ride? Good. Steering? Good. Throttle and brakes? Good.

The Wilderness trim even raises the ride-height, adds a CVT cooler so it can tow 3500 lbs, strengthens the roof rails, and adds some durable cladding to protect its slick blue colour.

I even found that the stock Geolander rubber did most (ish) of what a dedicated set of snows could do.

I was a happy little Subarurer for a whole week.

Oh, and Subaru gets extra points for not Volkswagening the interior. Physical buttons are placed where needed, and the infotainment worked perfectly.

All of this for 40 Grand CAD.

I’d take one over the 2.5 Mazda 3 AWD hatch, the Civic AND the Corolla.

So to Mr. @engineeringexplained I say this: I am sorry. The Subaru Crosstrek might be the best vehicle ever made.*

- Thomas

*disclaimer: It’s obviously not the best vehicle ever made.""

123,1708367051.0,What car isn’t daily-able these days?,"I’ve driven a lot of cars in life and two themes really stike me now:

1. Almost any utility car can be highly performant, from Raptors to Cayennes and sub 3 second electric SUVs you can get. Mind blowing performance out of a family car.
2. Almost any super car is now entirely daily-able. Sports, performance, and Super cars  drive like well behaved luxury sedans around town now.

the genre of performance driving on-road has sort of converged where you can get a highly performant car in any form or fashion you want.

So my question to you all is, what ISN’T dailyable these days?",cars
124,1708366992.0,Why aren't screens used more than guages in custon consumer performance vehicles?,"As a fan of restomods, I always wondered if guages could easily be replaced by just having all the information you need on a head unit instead. I guess most famous example would be what Brian had is Fast and Furious (4), but basically more customizable than that.

Like wouldn't it be convenient to have your head unit with Android Auto and Apple Carplay be able to double up as your boost pressure monitor or whatever you need cause you can customzie it like a dashboard. Like even for older cars, it would make visual clutter more centralized, and you can have bigger screens that just 2-DIN to show information, while having physical switches to adjust specific needs still.

Also, this isn't there to replace those units that are able to display the information along with speed and have shift lights, but rather to compliment them.

Honestly I'm just surprised an Android Head Unit hasn teen able to fully take advantage of this gap between street cars and performance race cars.

We seem to be stuck between gasoline cars being phased out, and electric cars that are still not quite ready for prime-time.

Automakers seem to be focused on selling cars with half-baked driver-assist/cruise control and putting touchscreens on the dash for infotainment purposes in emulation of Tesla, even in their gas-powered vehicles. 

True, fully self-driving autos still seem to be years, if not decades away.

But gas-powered cars that drivers *want* to own & drive, because they *enjoy* driving them seem to be a low priority for the auto manufacturers. Manual transmissions are few and far between, but cruise control/lane control/blaind spot assist is almost a standard feature, now. 

This, at a time when real car enthusiasts are roaring around town in modded custom gas-powered vehicles that are clearly central to their lifestyle...for now. But 5-10 years from now, will you even be able to purchase a new gas-powered car, or maintain your old one, and afford the fuel for it?

136,1708299084.0,2023 RS3 vs. 2023 Civic Type R owner review and comparison,"**TL;DR because this is long as fuck:**

The Civic Type R is the driver’s car of the two. The RS3 is an amazing daily with a great engine. Ultimately I do not need or want two cars, and I sold the RS3 because it’s less practical and will depreciate more. Sorry in advance this post is so long.

**Why I bought both:**

You know people who say, “the Civic Type R is so marked up I might as well just buy an RS3.” I did that. A dealer reached out to me with an RS3 at MSRP last summer and I went for it (they’re not hard to find at MSRP now but back then they were). Then in December I found a Civic Type R for MSRP and bought that. I have 1,500 miles on the Civic and put almost 10K on the RS3.

**Exterior:**

I think both cars look good but neither is amazing. I prefer how the previous-gen RS3 looked. The proportions of the 8Y (current gen) are good but the front grill looks a bit garbage. Mine was in Kayalami Green which is the best color for the car IMO.

The FL5 (Civic Type R) looks slightly better to me. My biggest aesthetic complaint is that the front end looks like it’s melting off of the car. And I wish it was a real hatchback and not a liftback.

Both cars are wide as hell — something to think about. They feel big on the road because they are. A con for both!

**Interior:**

The FL5 interior is… fine? Reviewers breathlessly gush about how the fucking climate knobs are like a finely-crafted-watch-jewelry-whatever-the-fuck and literally it feels like a decent economy car interior. Which it is. The plastics mostly feel like shit, but there’s very little gloss black plastic so that’s cool. Mine had rattles from day one though they go away as the car warms up. Some things feel a bit olden times: like why does this car have USB-A ports? And the low resolution of the infotainment screen means your CarPlay icons are big enough for grandma to operate (this is actually annoying in Google Maps because you can only see the route like 10 feet in front of you). Even the resolution of the gauge cluster is a low — you can see the anti-aliasing.

But everything that matters is great. The steering wheel is the right size and it feels great. There are physical buttons for everything. There are shift lights. The shifter feel is incredible. The seats are incredible. The aesthetic of the red seats and carpet makes the car feel special. Most importantly, the gauge cluster stays in individual mode every time you start the car. This is a surprisingly big plus to me. More on this later.

The RS3 interior does not feel like $65K. But it’s much nicer than the FL5. Every piece of plastic feels nicer. It still has physical buttons for everything important. My car did not have a single rattle over almost 10K miles. The seats are not sporty, but they are very comfortable, heated, and have a memory function. The infotainment screen feels like it was actually made in the 2020s. I would rather take a road trip in this car 10/10 times.

But it falls apart a bit when you drive the car hard.

**Driving dynamics:**

Point the RS3 where you want to go and push go on the pedal and you will go there. It’s fast and from a stoplight you can beat almost anything that’s not an EV. AWD means that driving in the rain or snow is more fun than the CTR.

But the inputs are not as good. The steering wheel feels like it came out of a Q7. The steering weight is light, even on its heaviest mode. And that wouldn’t bug me except the car also has very little steering feel. The seating position is high (at 6’1” I barely fit with a helmet), and while the seats are comfortable they are not very supportive.

And then there’s the rear diff. This makes the car come alive in the corners — you can absolutely feel it rotate under power. This is a highlight of the car, but also a downside. At speed, the rear end of the car can feel a bit floaty (especially in torque rear mode which I didn’t like). This combined with the lack of steering feel and uncommunicative seats means the car is somewhat difficult to push, just because I didn’t really know what it was doing. Where are the limits of grip? I’m not sure. I always wanted more information than it would give me.

I should also talk about the engine. I’ve mostly owned hot hatches and was never really an “engine guy.” But I get it. It’s really special and it’s basically the reason to buy the car. But it’s also… disappointing? For one, it’s too quiet! The car adds engine noise through the speakers which actually does sound great, but I wish I could hear the real thing. The previous generation was better in this regard.

And the car is fast. But the torque doesn’t really hit until \~4000 RPM. I think turbo lag provides some excitement, but this combined with the not-lightning-fast DSG means there were quite a few times where I wanted to go fast but the car wasn’t ready yet. I owned a DCT Elantra N and the transmission in that car was better than the one in the RS3, both in auto and manual mode.

The FL5 is the opposite in a lot of ways. The steering feel is not awesome, but it’s worlds better than the RS3. That combined with the low seating position, super grippy seats, and excellent manual transmission means I always know exactly what is going on.

The car also always starts in individual mode — which to me is a huge plus and makes it feel like an older, more analogue car. Unlike the RS3, I don’t have to switch a different drive mode if I want to pass someone. It’s a more satisfying, more immediate driving experience. I wish more new cars did this.

On a dry, twisty road, I am faster in the FL5 than the RS3. I’m more confident in the car and can push it harder. When driving the FL5 hard, it really feels like you are connected to the car, whereas the RS3 feels more like you’re sitting on top of it.

But the FL5 sounds like garbage. Totally uninspiring. And the lower power + FWD means that you’re not beating anyone from a red light. It’s also not really fun in the rain or snow. But give me a dry, twisty road and I’ll take it every time.

**Daily driving:**

No surprise but the RS3 is a better daily in almost every way. For one… the two cars get the same fuel economy (\~22 in my mostly city driving). The RS3 actually does better on the highway (low-to-mid 30s!). This is great for the RS3 and embarrassing for the Civic.

Ah fuck I also forgot to mention the range. The gas tank on the Civic is so small — I get like 220 miles before I have to fill up. On the RS3 I can easily do 280, and up to 400 with highway miles. Pretty big annoyance on the FL5.

The FL5 is also loud as fuck inside. Not cool-loud, either. There’s no cool engine sound to hear. Instead: tire noise. This is one of the biggest cons of the car for me, and it’s stupid that the car is this loud.

The suspension on the FL5 is also too stiff. You can install a $200 module from the Integra Type S and it makes it better — I’d say this is a necessary mod for anyone who doesn’t hate themself. But the RS3 suspension is still way more comfortable and I would argue just objectively better.

The RS3 also has so many useful features that a $46K Civic really should have. Parking sensors. Auto wipers. Auto folding mirrors. Heated seats. You can buy an Integra Type S if you want some of that stuff, but I think even MSRP for the Civic is pushing what the platform is worth — and you lose the seats/special interior, which is like 50% of what makes the car cool to me.

One surprise: the FL5 Bose system sounds better than the upgraded B&O system on the RS3, which is garbage considering it’s an upgrade. (But only sitting still, once you add tire roar in the FL5, the RS3 does sound better.)

All of that said, the FL5 is a perfectly serviceable and very practical daily, and not a painful place to be once you change the suspension module. It also has more interior space with the larger back seats and the hatch.

**Price:**

The RS3 is $20K more than the FL5, but costs add up in other ways too. There’s no included maintenance, and maintenance is not cheap (the Civic comes with 2 years free). The tires are staggered so you can’t rotate them, and both replacement tires and aftermarket wheels cost more. Brakes are expensive. Depreciation is worse. And I personally would not want to own the car out of warranty.

**Tires:**

Just a note that the stock RS3 tires (Pirelli P Zero) are garbage. In some ways I can’t believe they ship the car with them. But once I took them off I realized they’re also pretty fun. The car wants to step out a bit with them on, which is bad for driving at high speeds but maybe more fun for street legal speeds around town.

**Verdict:**

The Civic Type R is the driver’s car of the two. The RS3 is an amazing daily with a great engine. Both are special cars.

I only wanted to own one car, and decided to sell the RS3 for two boring reasons. One, the hatch and storage space of the FL5 is much better — I carry video gear around regularly for work, and the RS3 was too small. Two, I think the FL5 will depreciate less over time, both as a percentage of the car’s MSRP and in absolute numbers.

But I would be happy to own either car. I actually learned from owning the RS3 that I don't need to have the most connected driver's car (FL5) — I'm also pretty happy owning something with decently good driving dynamics and a cool engine. I feel like car reviewers often review cars as if the buyer will be able to drive 8/10 every time they drive... when in reality that's not the case for a daily. As a transportation device, I totally understand people who go for something softer and more luxurious.

Finally, I think both of these cars are just barely worth their MSRP. They’re both fast versions of much cheaper cars, and I think they’re expensive for what you get. Before owning them I owned two Elantra Ns (one manual, one DCT), and that car is a true value for the money — even more so with the upcoming refresh which does not look quite as ugly.",cars

It should completely replace the CVT line in my opinion which shouldn't be there. This would NEVER happen, but bonus points if they give it eAWD just for the Integra and call it e-SHAWD or some marketing crap. I could honestly see sales explode because consumers want interior space, reliability, and fuel economy and now with a slightly better badge and e-AWD on top of that. It would absolutely move numbers, and it'd be cheap enough since they just plug and chug the Civic hybrid powertrain they're already bringing. The Prius is already selling like hotcakes, why not give the people what they want?  
  
In my guess, Honda's early EV endeavors with GM will be a dud. It's just too expensive for what it is, and why would the typical Honda buyer trust GM? The Prologue and ZDX flopping will hopefully push Honda to realize they need more hybrids while they perfect their own unique EV platform which I still believe is the future.

Most exotic or high-end cars like Lambos, Ferraris, and Mclarens have long since swapped to the paddle shifters. In today's automatics, you can use paddle shifters without fear of damaging your car. Sim racing has exploded in the last couple of years, and with that explosion has been the market for accessories like an h pattern shifter. Why can't we have that as an option in an EV? Imagine a three-pedal setup that you can turn on or off if you want. Got 5 o'clock traffic that will be at a standstill? Use the auto self-driving mode. Got a nice afternoon drive through an empty highway? Swap to the manual mode and use your third pedal. It will not be the same as a real manual transmission but it would at least be a fun alternative and could help separate nonsport car versions from the sport EVs. With the progression of technology, we might even be able to eventually simulate the real feedback that a modern transmission offers. Imagine a manual power EV that never needs a clutch replacement and feels exactly like your current manual but also if you miss a shift you're not worried about ruining your transmission.

153,1708197737.0,Will sport version cars be a thing of the past?,"With the world's transition to electric vehicles, do you think sport versions will be a thing of the past? I can't imagine anyone willing to pay double for an electric M4 compared to the regular I4, as the only differences would be a bigger battery, suspension and some interior and exterior pieces for looks. The same can be said about Mercedes' AMG-lineup, Audi's S- and RS-lineup, VW's R-lineup, etc. etc. Not to mention luxury car brands such as Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren etc. Maybe it's just because I'm not a fan of the forced switch whatsoever, but a bigger battery is nothing like a different and more powerful engine. We love the C63 and RS6 for their V8 engines. To me, the higher prices are justified as they are completely different cars than the regular versions. But a bigger battery? What's really the difference? Just a slightly faster 0-60. I don't see how sport cars and sport versions will ever be sold, when the ""sport"" is getting taken away and all cars will feel the same. There's no wow-factor over an electric vehicle rolling by, even if it's a Ferrari or whatever. The sound is a vital part of what makes sport cars desirable.

Hydrogen does not have a shot in the passenger vehicle market. Annual sales of the Toyota Mirai have [never surpassed 3,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Mirai#Markets_and_sales) a year. A common excuse I see is that fuel cell vehicles are a ‘new technology’, [but they’re not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle). Also, remember those [pictures of President Bush](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7978890) standing next to a fuel cell vehicle? Lol.

156,1708188175.0,Picked up my new car today: 2020 Suzuki Swift Sport,"I picked up my new (to me) Suzuki Swift Sport today, after unfortunately crashing and writing off my previous 2018 Swift Sport. Seeing as this car isn't something most of the people on this sub (Americans) will have heard much about, I thought I'd show it off a bit and show you my thoughts on a car that in theory r/cars should love: its lightweight (1,025 kg/2260 lbs), only available in manual (in the UK), and despite relatively low power still feels quick and is fun to chuck around. 

This particular car is the mild hybrid which was introduced in 2020 to meet stricter European emission standards which is technically down on power from the non-hybrid (129 vs 140 hp) but doesn't really feel it due to the extra torque from the electric motor. Despite its weight it also has plenty of standard equipment like radar adaptive cruise control which I wouldn't want a car without anymore! 

It probably wouldn't do too well in the American market (not helped by Suzuki leaving entirely) due to its small size but I think some of the enthusiasts on here would love it - I certainly do!

171,1708093481.0,Why companies kill better older engine designs?,"I was pondering this question recently.

Before my current 2.0 Accord, I had a V6 2016 model. I averaged better MPG than the 2.0T by a significant margin. Same tires, same roads, same trips for years, the V6 with a 6 speed automatic averaged 34 MPG during my ownership, where as so far the 2.0T over the course of 40k miles has averaged 30 MPG. Both times I did better than the average quoted by Honda, but considering I drive like 80% highway miles, this makes sense. What doesn't is this:

2016 Accord V6 6AT - 33 Hwy, 21 City, 25 combined.

2021 Accord 2.0T 10AT - 32 Hwy, 22 City, 26 combined.

I understand that the reason it was done, was emissions, but if the MPG was pretty much the same, and at least in my personal use case, better, with an NA v6 engine, why switch? I did some testing, back in the day and on the highway exclusively with cylinder deactivation on, I could easily push well into the high 30's on the highway with the J35, 37 was very possible, and I can get close, but not quite, with the 2.0, usually at best 35. Of course thats hyper milling it.

I get the argument that ""the 2.0 turbo makes more torque earlier in the rev range) but realistically, its by about 40lbft at most, the J35 head flowed really well at low RPM, and at about 2200 RPM made 235lbft, the 2.0T peak torque comes in at 2000RPM at 275 lbft and would drop off from there, where as the J35 made more torque as RPM climbed.

So considering the 2.0T is smaller displacement, and has 4 more gears, gets over all the same if not slightly worse MPG for marginally more torque at lower RPM. The fact that boost comes in so early, it makes driving it in the city horrible for has mileage, but not better than the outgoing v6.

The real argument, I think, is cost and packaging. The J35 is a big motor, but what is crazy, is that when I had it, side by side with my wife's ES350, it had way more room in the engine bay to fit like a whole K20 in there. The 2GR in a FWD application is the biggest pain when it  comes to working on it because of packaging. I pretty much never had an issue reaching anywhere in the honda, it was well designed.

With the Turbo, there is room for a two motors in that engine bay, and the Accord has only gotten BIGGER. The current generation hybrid only version, has room for a small family under the hood.

So cost is probably the last point, and specifically, manufacturing cost, since honda can spend less money casting 4 cylinders, while out sourcing the turbo and all its related components to MHI, and simply pay for the assembly at the line. But how much could that really save?

In the current line up, all things being equal, the ""hybrid only"" accord is at best, a waste of space, and at most, a waste of money (with how they gate keep certain features behind the touring trim. For example, I can add the JBL audio system to a base camry for a fee, where as the Bose system is reserved only for the touring trim, this is just one example). I get that for some, the hybrid makes sense, I drove the current generation accord hybrid, and its...meh. Its very nice, but its not so nice that it warrants the price, plus past 50mph it really struggles to accelerate when we had Me, my wife, and the sales person in it, and past 65, you aren't passing anyone with out a few minutes warning.

I digress, but point being, I don't understand the goals and rationale here, since the J35 is still made and being improved for the Pilot, Ridgeline, and Odyssey, and the 2.0T is put into every single Acura product, why get rid of it, and replace it with a not even class leading hybrid system.

Why not sell the hybrid along side the 2.0T or V6 when their are no issues with fuel economy, packaging, cost, manufacturing constrains, etc. I cannot find a SINGLE logical reason why this can' be done. We know the J35 can take the 10AT, and that might even improve its mileage. The odyssey improved mpg and horsepower from 2016 to 2022 for example.

TLDR:

Why are cars getting progressively worse engine option wise when new ""emissions friendly"" engines don't actually get better fuel economy. My example is the accord v6 vs the 2.0t, where MPG stayed stagnant even with better engineering and down sizing, eventually dropping both engines in favor of hybrids, while still making both great engines. No reason to not use them in an accord for example. More car makes do the same, dropping good engines in favor of worse engines that don't really improve fuel economy, and if they do, its by simply making less power.

""Hi, I’m K.C. Colwell, executive editor of Car and Driver and one of the drivers at our annual Lightning Lap track test. Every year we put the hottest new performance cars through the ultimate test: lapping Virginia International Raceway’s 4.1-mile Grand Course, a track we consider the toughest in the U.S. It was a good year, and we'll have all the details in our March/April issue and on the website. 

This is the 17th Lightning Lap, and our all-time leaderboard is now 327 production cars deep. But this year we invited more than just production cars. Subaru Motorsports brought out Airslayer with legendary driver Scott Speed at the wheel. Built by Vermont SportsCar, Airslayer amounts to an uncorked rallycross car. It’s got a real Can-Am vibe. Porsche racer Patrick Long lapped a 911 GT3 RS on the Full Course to see how it compares with the current 911 race car. And somehow, we convinced Hendrick Motorsports to bring its Garage 56 NASCAR Camaro out and to agree to let us drive it. But not for time. IMSA veteran and G56 development driver Jordan Taylor did the lapping at speed. And before you ask, yes, it is every bit as awesome as it looked and sounded at Le Mans last June. 

We also answered the question, is two better than four? As in: car versus motorcycle. BMW factory rider Nate Kern brought a BMW M 1000RR out to VIR. He’s raced at VIR a bunch, but he’s never tackled Grand. The stories don’t go live until 2/22 at 9:00 AM ET, but once they are, you can find them at https://www.caranddriver.com.

In a lot of Mazda 3 posts, people often bring up the car's torsion rear beam when discussing how unsporty its suspension set-up is (especially on the Turbo model in North America).

Now that Mazda's new Spirit Racing brand developing a proper 3 hot hatch, a few people say that its ride & handling will be compromised due to that torsion beam.

https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/19dof9f/mazda_spirit_racing_teases_more_nimble_and/?ref=share&ref_source=link

So, I'm just wondering how did Renault Sport get away with that?

The Megane RS competed regularly with the CTR for FWD honours on the Nurburgring. Yet, both the older three-door Megane III and the last IV five-door use torsion rear beams. Even the specced-out £72k Trophy-R created to get the FWD record keeps the beam.

Halfway thru writing this, I found [JayEmm's Megane 280 Cup review](https://youtu.be/FKj6PkeMBqI?t=374). I'll paraphrase the part where he starts talking about the Megane's torsion beam:

> ...However, the guys at Renault have anticipated my concerns. You see, they fitted what they would term, I suppose, a ""double-damper"" technology. This is apparently pretty common in rally cars and whatnot, but, what they do is this car does not have any sort of active damping or things - which I think is a very good thing. It instead has a very trick system, which means there's almost a damper-within-a-damper; so, your stock inner suspension is itself hydraulic. Which means that when you're over those tougher compressions, those more unexpected lumps and bumps, you don't just suddenly hit that end-stop. It'll still be moving to come to a halt

>> Now, I'm just gonna let traffic ahead kinda clear itself, so that I've got a clear road so that I could see if this works. At lower speeds, the car rides... reasonably firmly, but not at all uncomfortably. It's still a compliant enough ride. I mean, would expect a firm ride from anything with the word 'Cup' in the title.

Elsewhere, I found this [article](https://www.torque.com.sg/reviews/renault-megane-rs-is-a-gallic-hot-hatch-with-extra-garlic/) describing the double damper:

>Regardless of drive mode, the damping remains unchanged. Even without electronically controlled dampers, and riding on seemingly rudimentary front struts and rear beam axle, the Megane can offer Renault Sport chassis magic in the form of bump-stop hydraulic compression shock absorbers. This rallying-inspired technology is described by the automaker as “a shock absorber within the shock absorber”.

>>The double-dampers effectively cushion the Megane RS over speed bumps, potholes, rough roads, and even when clipping over trackside chicanes.

I know the Megane RS also benefits from 4-wheel steering and has their own PerfoHub front strut design like Honda does; neither of which Mazda might have atm. But I think it's interesting to see how Renault Sport approached this design limit.

I'm not certain how Mazda plans to tackle this same challenge. I hear that Spirit Racing's Mazda 3 that they're testing in Super Taikyu still uses a torsion beam. Whereas the 3 TCR that got cancelled due to COVID-19 used rear independent struts.

Still, I thought this could be interesting enough to discuss. Any Megane RS owners here?",cars

The Abarth 500 is one of those tiny pocket rockets I'd love to own, and despite its niche, wished it had more direct competition.

So I'm pretty surprised to learn that Opel made a hot version of the Adam that stayed largely under the radar. Apparently, in the UK, the S model was previously called the Adam 'Grand Slam'

- 150 horsepower, 163 lb-ft from a turbocharged 1.4L EcoTec four-cylinder

- 6-speed manual

- brakes from the bigger Corsa VXR/OPC

- VXR/OPC tuned suspension.

The main thing that killed it was being priced too close to bigger, more powerful subcompacts like the Fiesta ST. I'd bet a lack of awareness also did it in. There aren't many around and parts may be hard to find.

This is actually JayEmm's second review of the Adam S and it looks like such a hoot. I also learnt that there was a rally racing model called the Adam R2 that used GM's bigger 1.6L turbo and made 182HP - a street version with the Astra K's 197hp engine variant might've been an awesome Abarth killer.

Side note - I saw a few articles stating that in the mid 2010s, [Buick once planned to import the Adam into America](https://www.motortrend.com/news/buick-boss-no-longer-interested-bringing-opel-adam-u-s/). I guess Americans missed out on another interesting pocket rocket",cars

But also tracked my abarth 500 (DD) and a trans am, ss 1le, e46 etc

During christmas, my BIL let me take his 2023 Ferrari F8 Tributo out for a spin... and was not gentle and put it through it's paces as much as I could; in race mode I redlined 1st and 2nd gear a couple times (scared the shit out of him). I knew he was going to let me drive it so I spent quite some time watching reviews (throttle house etcetc) on it and how everyone raved about its handling and soul.

My initial reaction was the interior was almost sub par for a 450k car... the carpeted panel on the floorboard loosened, the screen resolution was kind of dated and the fit and finish was arguably worse than my XC90.

The driving was also... muted (maybe a 458 with the highrevving NA engine would have changed the experience)

Regardless.... I wasn't sure what I was expecting. I grew up idolizing Ferraris and was just expecting to be completely blown away for whatever reason.

Now through talking about this experience with my friends, I realized that perhaps the fact that I was able to redline a sub 3200 lb car with 711HP and have it feel ""Boring"" was what makes it such a marvel of automotive engineering.

But in some stupid way, I feel it would've been better subjectively, if it was worse objectively... I wanted it to feel special and blow my mind.. and it didn't. It just putted along unfazed and unfrazzled",cars

They protect them from sunlight (UV being the main culprit) which degrades paint and leather.  

 I think there’s more to this, like temperature variations, that contribute to the degradation of a car in time. You can heat or cool a garage, and you can also fully protect the cars from sunlight.

314,1707248917.0,I test drove a few cars ahead of my next purchase..,"Over the last three weeks I have test driven 4 cars as the lease on my 2020 MB C300 4matic is expiring. All 2024 models, they were the Tesla Model Y (2023), Toyota Prius, BMW 230i xDrive, Audi A4, and the Volvo S60. My thoughts:

&#x200B;

Tesla Model Y:

Great UI. Accelerates like a rocket. But the inability to glide with your foot off the pedal just doesn't work for me. Driving my partner around would surely give her motion sickness as it seems like a steep learning curve to drive in a smooth fashion. But even after 15 minutes of city/hwy driving I couldn't get my brain to work that way. Maybe more patience is needed, but that added with the cheap interior disguised as ""minimalist"" just wasn't for me. I can see the appeal, but I don't have a charge port in my condo parking spot. Also they told me I would be unable to buy the car out of lease when it expires. Strange.

&#x200B;

BMW 230i xDrive:

Wonderful little coupe. What I believe to be the sweet spot in their ICE lineup. Just enough power, great driving dynamics, sport paddles are snappy quick. Smooth over the rough roads in my city. Overall a great driving experience. The large display that curves into the instrument cluster as well as the interior lighting seemed like a lot for night time driving (I test drove after sunset), and I could see that being a bit annoying on long night drives. I am sure there is a way to dim it, but that many screens/just seems like a lot. Also many features that were buttons in the previous generation are now buried in the infotainment screen. The UI is great, but certainly a bit of a clusterfuck visually. The overall build quality seemed okay, not up to snuff like BMWs of the past (I owned a 2016 435i for a few years). Things like the weight of the door and trunk felt a little tinny and more closer to its Asian rivals than that of a solid luxury German. As far as road noise it was about on par as the 435i however. 

&#x200B;

Audi A4 Progressive:

Silky smooth sedan driving experience. Steering as light as ever when cruising around a parking lot but stiff enough to give great feedback when cornering an on-ramp. Steering and a cushiony ride was certainly the major plus in this car. Infotainment and UI seemed decent enough. It did however feel crazy underpowered. Even in sport mode/manual mode, it just does not have the get and go umph off of a stop like the BMW or MB C300 for example. That was disappointing. Even passing at speed felt a little underpowered and laggy. I had a 2010 A4 as a rental a few years ago, and the powertrain felt the same in terms of lag, but I assume that 2.0t now has some extra weight to push around. That would be my only complaint. But certainly the most expensive and solid feeling/quiet of any of my test drives. 

&#x200B;

Toyota Prius Limited:

Overall a cool experience. Getting 45-50mpg is always intriguing. The fit and finish on the interior was as good as anything I test drove. Very solid feeling. It felt powerful enough to do any of your daily driving. Overall a great driving experience. The engine braking to the charge the battery was interesting (not as bad as the Tesla), but it was a nice drive. Unfortunately the high price tag and 8.5% lease rate just won't work for me, as this additional expense wont be recouped with gas savings. I am glad I test drove one, though. 

&#x200B;

Volvo S60 (top trim)

A decent driving experience. I love the look of these, from the headlights to the taillights to the body lines. I love the presence they have - subdued luxury and style. The fit and finish on the inside was good enough. The UI was okay, Google-powered so it would make more sense for an android/google phone. It has google maps/assistant built into the vehicle UI, and Apple Carplay can only be had through wire connection only. So I can see that being annoying. It does however have the ability to have Spotify as its own app onboard the UI, so technically a simple bluetooth connection will integrate your maps and music fine - which is mostly the whole point of Carplay (I rarely read/respond to messages while driving). As far as driving goes, steering was light and luxurious - but not on Audi's level. Power was decent - but not on BMW/MB's level. Over bumps was decent as well, not as good as Audi but better than BMW/MB. It seems like a perfect in-between car that does everything above average without the outlandish styling and brand image of the other luxury brands. The one shining feature this car did have was the upgraded B&W sound system ($3000+ stand alone option!!). Wow. Probably the best car stereo you can buy from the factory these days. Also at 4.75% lease rate, seems like a great option.

&#x200B;

So that is my last few weeks of test drives. I don't know which direction I will go. I loved all of them, but especially liked the A4 for its comfy driving, BMW for its sportiness, and the Volvo for its looks/sound system. It was cool to test them all within a few days of each other. Let me know any other questions you might have, but figured this write up would help anyone debating to get/test drive one of these cars.",cars

318,1707242069.0,Test Drove a Mazda3 Turbo this week.,"I had about 30 min with the car on some pretty nice curvy back roads.

My current daily is a MK7 GTI.

You guys were not kidding, the interior is fantastic. After adjusting the driver seat to a comfortable position (I'm 5 ""11). I gave the back seat a try and felt that it was adequately comfortable. 

Driving the car on back roads and really attacking them, it was pretty fun!  You can feel the AWD working, and keeping the car from under steering.  The actual steering took some getting used to because it isn't as quick as my GTI's but it felt natural after a few minutes.

The suspension soaked up any imperfections in the road well, and I honestly didn't notice the rear end being upset by mid-corner bumps as stated in other reviews (maybe the roads weren't bad enough). 

Power wise it felt great in the tight curves I was on. Certainly quicker than my GTI when it was stock, but it isn't on par with the current stage 1 93 octane tune on my car. I'm unsure of the octane that the dealer put in the Mazda though so it may have a bit more power than I experienced. Honestly it was plenty of power for the type of driving I do.

The hatch seems practical but the floor of the hatch is recessed about 3 or 4 inches.

All in all I would certainly consider buying one, it's such a great looking car inside and out. I don't think it's as sporty as my GTI, but that car is tuned with coil overs and pretty aggressive tires. I think with some sportier tires the Mazda could be made bit a more fun without sacrificing its comfort too much. 

Maybe I'm missing something, but I felt the Mazda 3 turbo is pretty fun, and don't really get the impression that it isn't an enjoyable drive.


EDIT:

To add info about the automatic transmission. In sport mode it seemed fairly responsive. Manual mode was OK and shifts were quick but not quite on par with a dual clutch. I didn't test to see if it would deny me a downshift like is common with some cars, but I was mostly content with leaving it in sport mode the majority of the time I spent with it.",cars

Same with Toyota’s attitude towards EVs. Kodak who were the biggest film manufacturer had several chances to adapt to digital especially considering they invented the digital camera and the Bayer Filter which is used in the vast majority of cameras today and they did take it eventually but it was too late. There was too much competition from Nikon, Canon and others and they eventually declared bankruptcy due to financial issues. Not saying Toyota will go bankrupt but I could see all this lax attitude towards EVs and hydrogen crap backfiring and them not being a major player in an EV dominant world.",cars
321,1707229432.0,A tight steering ratio is the single most import factor in determining how fun a car is to drive. Accord vs Mazda 3 vs Miata. The Accord has the tightest ratio,"I host cars on Turo and as a result I get to live out my r/whatcarshouldIbuy dreams of owning every economy car I want. A few of the cars we have include a 16 Miata, 18 Accord and 19 Mazda 3.

Intro: Despite being 300 lbs heavier and 1 foot longer, I find the Accord to be more fun than the Mazda 3. The Accord should feel slower, bulkier and more unwieldy, but it doesn't. Every day I choose my base Accord on Ling Longs over my top spec Mazda 3 on Bridgestones. For the longest time I couldn't figure it out and then it finally came to me. It's the steering ratio.

Mazda say they chose a wide steering ratio as a measure of safety.  [That when people are faced with an emergency scenario they tend to over react.](https://youtu.be/w4OaQhyXJMA?si=KFKpuZM0jrw2MGfJ&t=11) Ford applied similar thinking to their Mustang. In an attempt to keep their cars from being viral sensations they widened their ratio from 15:1 ratio in the S197 to 19:1 in the S550.

The safety factor goes beyond reaction time. At speed a tight ratio will make a car feel twitchy. According to Journalist Jason Cammisa he once suggested to a German company that they make a car with a tight steering ratio like a Alfa Romeo Guilia. That the car would be more fun to drive. The  German car company told him that they wouldn't do that. A tight steering ratio would make their cars too unstable and twitchy for the autobahn.

One final note in favor of safety. If a cars power steering fails, it's much easier to control a car with a wide ratio as it increases your leverage.

As a logical decision it makes perfect sense that a company should use a wide rack... but it's just not fun. With a tighter ratio cars feel more responsive, sharper and smaller. Let's lay it out real quick.

1965 Ford Galaxy (no power steering) - 23.3 : 1 , 119""

2015 Ford Mustang - 19 : 1 , wheelbase 107.1""

2018 Alfa Romeo Guilia - 11.8 : 1 , wheelbase 111.0""

2020 Mazda Miata - 15.5 : 1 , wheelbase 90.9""

2008 Ford Mustang - 15 : 1 , wheelbase 107.1""

2018 Honda Accord - 11.8 : 1 , wheelbase 111.4""

2019 Mazda 3 wide - Wide af. Trust me bro. wheelbase 107.3""

2015 C7 Corvette - variable-ratio rack-and-pinion with electric power assist. 12.0 to 16.4 , wheelbase 106.7""

2020 911 Carrera S - variable-ratio rack-and-pinion with electric power assist. 15.0 : 1 (on-center) to 12.25 : 1

Go Kart - 1 : 1 , wheelbase 41.25""

Ducati Panigale V4 - 1 : 1 , wheelbase  57.9""

To clear something up, you'll notice that the Accord has a tighter ratio than a Miata. Obviously the Accord does not feel sharper or twitchier than a Miata. Wheelbase plays a massive role in this equation. Also I couldn't find the Mazda 3 rack ratio. I tried to calculate it one my own but the numbers weren't adding up. Rack ratios are not included on most standard spec sheets which is a major oversight imo.

All of this is to say that the Accord is a lot more enjoyable to drive. It feels smaller and significantly more responsive. You see a similar effect in other cars.

I think the Mazda's design is the best in the world but the car is just a bit too... healthy. It's like if you went to Pizza Hut for their salad bar. Is a salad better for you than a pizza? Yes, absolutely, but the pizza will be far more satisfying. The Accord's design is sloppier but you get what you want. Tighter steering and an obscene amount of interior space.

[This is part 2 in my Mazda 3 vs Accord series. The previous part covered the powertrain differences between the Mazda and the Accord.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/175jxa0/reddits_academic_understanding_of_the_mazda_3_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

A final note on steering feel. The Mazda 3 has better on center steering feel but the Accord ultimately requires less effort due to its lane keep assist. People don't talk about it much but the Mazda 3 is one of the only cars in its class that doesn't offer lane keep assist.

323,1707196442.0,Who makes the most robust infotainment?,"Everyone likes to harp on piano black materials and haptic buttons, but no one ever seems to mention the robustness of the actual software. I’m curious: who makes the most reliable integration that just works consistently and furthermore is snappy and responsive?

The criteria for this requires modern features like music streaming, maps, and hands free call and text assistance. I don’t care that a 40 year old pickup truck with a tape deck works every time you crank it.

My experiences so far:

- Mazda: stock maps and navigation is terrible. CarPlay is a requirement. I had to have my 2017 Miata RF retrofitted to do native CarPlay and it was… passable, but wired. Didn’t matter much since there was no place to put your phone when you had to plug it in, then the passenger seat was so insanely sensitive that the weight of my iPhone 12 mini was enough to set off the passenger detector. It occasionally just refused to connect, though.

- Porsche: CarPlay works fine, sometimes, but most of the other smart features just crap out all the time. I haven’t been able to use remote park assist for weeks now. Occasionally the system will just get stuck in an endless loading loop and I can’t use native applications or CarPlay period. CarPlay also doesn’t really extend to my HUD or center display, so native Apple Music, maps, and Spotify are usually better integrated but simply do not work half the time. 

- Pioneer: I had an early CarPlay compatible deck in my old GTI. It usually worked, but would occasionally take so long to boot that I would arrive at my destination before I could get anything meaningful done. This was likely the heat of charging a phone while also doing a lot of processing making the device heat throttle. 

- Audi: only test drove a newer Audi RS5, but in my hour with the car it seemed to be super snappy but I could be mistaken and I would be interested to hear what owners have to say",cars

Why is this a thing? Why is it first now that the old auto manufacturers are starting to understand that people don't want cars that looks like space dildos. And how many years will it take them to understand that we also don't need them to be new models.

Peugeot has made the fantastic decision to just sell their existing models (208, 3008, etc) with the option of ether having a combustion engine, PHEV, or EV engine.

337,1707060393.0,"GT4 RS - Personal experience, thoughts on the car","I waited for over a year to get my GT4 RS. During that time, I watched numerous YouTube videos and read most of the Rennlist, Reddit, and Facebook posts, so I had a good idea of what to expect. However, after receiving the car, I realized just how wrong I was—so wrong that I decided to write this ""review"" because many people are debating whether to buy this car, but they don't fully understand what they're getting into.

BACKGROUND: It's essential to consider where you're coming from and what you're expecting from this special car. Personally, I previously owned a manual 981 Base with a Borla exhaust, which, for me, offered the best value for money. I could rev it up, push it to the limit, and enjoy it both in the city and on the track, without focusing on 0-60 times or stoplight races. I also have a Renault track tool, which serves as my daily driver. It's stripped out with bucket seats, a straight pipe, short shifter, and coilovers. It's HARSH and LOWER than the GT4 RS, but I love driving it everywhere.Before purchasing the GT4 RS,

I also test-drove the following cars:

C63 S - Impressive torque and a great exhaust note, but not unique enough to justify the price.GTR AMG - Attractive looks, but not ideal for city driving fun. It had substantial torque, but it lacked emotional engagement at low speeds.

Huracan EVO - While it's a Lamborghini, I wasn't particularly drawn to it, considering my driving style and the high maintenance costs associated with it.

992 4S - Somewhat disappointing, possibly due to my high expectations. It gave me more of a grand tourer vibe. Some say the newer Caymans are like the old 911s, and after driving the 997, 992, 981, and 718, I can confirm that. However, if I were seeking a car for long trips, the 992 would be a suitable choice.

C8 - Impressive gearbox, but it had too much tech and felt too bulky for my preferences.

Emira - A fun car with nimble handling and a unique feel. However, I found the engine sound underwhelming, and the car had some electrical issues.

Now, regarding the GT4 RS:I didn't test drive it before buying it. I got a good deal, a $30,000 discount from the sticker price, and the car had only 70km because the previous owner didn't like it. It lacks mag wheels and a rear camera but is equipped with all other features, including a titanium roll bar. The only issue with the spec was the wheels, which initially looked odd with the PTS Rubystone color. However, after seeing the car in person, I fell in love with it.I would describe this car as a GoKart. It's analog, not overloaded with tech, fun, and it loves to rotate and slide. It's a bit rough, but not excessively so, making it suitable for daily driving. It's noisy, fun, and sharp, even at lower speeds. It's truly an event to drive. The only factors that might deter me from daily driving this car are rainy days, winter weather, and crowded parking [lots.Now](http://lots.now), let's address some of the issues mentioned in forums and YouTube videos:

**ISSUE 1: PDK-S vs. Manual** \- I initially had doubts due to a previous experience with an automatic gearbox, but the PDK-S in the GT4 RS is exceptional. The gear ratios and response time are amazing, creating an exhilarating experience. No regrets, and I wouldn't opt for a manual in the GT4 RS. However, I do plan to buy a base 987, 981, or 718 with a manual transmission for a different driving experience.

**Issue 2: Suspension is too harsh** \- Contrary to my expectations, the suspension in the GT4 RS is not overly harsh. Even my wife, who was concerned about it, was impressed with the ride quality. I now daily drive the GT4 RS in urban areas, and it's enjoyable. The engine's sound remains consistent throughout various gears, making it fun even during routine tasks like grocery shopping, going to the gym, or heading to work.

**Issue 3: Too loud** \- The car's volume is adjustable, allowing you to control how loud it is. Drive it in the lower RPM range, and it's relatively quiet. Push the throttle, and it roars as it should. If you're seeking silence at high speeds, this isn't the car for you. I might consider using AirPods on the highway in the future to reduce the noise during long cruises.

**Issue 4: Too low** \- The car comes equipped with a lift, and I've had no issues with parking ramps or speed bumps. I've only needed to use the lift on steeper parking ramps.

**Issue 5: GT3 vs. GT4 RS** \- While the GT3 might excel on the track, I opted for the GT4 RS because I wanted a car that would provide fun at lower speeds since I'll be tracking it only 30% of the time. The GT4 RS's noise, mid-engine layout, size, and agility make it a winner on the streets, even if it may not perform as well on the track. I'm extremely satisfied with this choice.Looking ahead, I plan to buy a manual base Cayman this year. In terms of upgrades, it's unlikely I'll find another modern car that meets my needs as well as the GT4 RS, but I'm considering adding a Singer to my garage as well.

I don't like how other cars have a base model with an attractive price but none of the standard features that make life easy, so you have to spend thousands of $$$ more for things like heated seats, a larger touchscreen, power liftgate etc, which only cost a few hundred dollars in total for the manufacturer. 

I wish all cars came fully loaded, with a price that's somewhere in between the base model and current fully loaded price. So they don't have to lose margin on the base trims, while also slightly losing margin on the loaded trims, therefore making the same amount of profit overall. 

I totally understand the economics and business reasons behind why manufacturers do trim levels, but I just don't like the customer experience that comes with it. It sucks to pay thousands more for a few must-have features that don't really cost a lot of money to make. And it also sucks to have a lower trim where you constantly feel regret not putting in the few $1000s to have those essential features. Basically there's no ""winning"" and no feeling of buying something you're 100% satisfied with. ",cars

Any different body style, whether it be a coupe, convertible, extended model, hybrids, or some weird 1 off body style. If it's ugly, I want to know about it.

375,1706726576.0,My CT4-V Blackwing vs wife's Audi RS3,"Blackwing [pics](https://imgur.com/a/0Txl8PS)

RS3 [pics](https://imgur.com/a/jksuCMg) 





I have been getting quite a few messages since I updated my flair to include our new purchase- Wife upgraded her 18 GTI to a 24 Audi RS3. We have so far put 1.2K miles on the RS3 and 5K miles on the Blackwing so felt its time to put down some thoughts if it would help someone cross shopping these cars.

**2023 CT4-V blackwing**- Electric blue, manual and mid tier seats (MSRP - 65.5K USD)

**2024 Audi RS3**- Kyalami green, tech package and performance exhaust ( MSRP - 66K USD)

Both were ordered through MSRP dealers and thanks to year end deals actually got 3.99 APR 48 month on the RS3.

**Exterior**  
Well, the kyalami green on the RS3 really pops. It makes my electric blue look subtle and a porsche gentian blue downright boring. The RS3 has more fake vents and grills than the blackwings. Especially the black honeycomb on the back is really ugly. I like the base wheels better on the RS3 though. They seem more interesting. Also like the standard red brakes. The biggest difference though is the size. The RS3 is a good 10 inches shorter in length and it feels it when parking and maneuvering. It has a short wheelbase and is a good 300lbs lighter than the blackwing.

**Interior**  
The afore mentioned 10 inches does not seem to affect interior room and cargo and the RS3 is a much roomier car than the blackwing. I can fit behind myself comfortably, something which I cannot do in the blackwing(6FT 200 Lbs). The interior of the RS3 looks nicer- the quilted leather is definitely nicer than my mid tier seats and I like the green stitching which matches the exterior(free!). The RS3 seats feel nicer for daily driving but I think the blackwing seats are better for canyon carving. The blackwing seats also have more adjustments with the bolsters and hip huggers.

So my biggest surprise was this though- for all the talk of the blackwing feeling cheap I think it actually holds up pretty well against the audi. It has less plastics in the places you regularly touch and more exotic elements(CF) in more places than the RS3. I also prefer the instrument cluster in the blackwing. The main screen is better in the audi though- bigger and better integrated. Overall I think I prefer the interior in the RS3 with some caveats. It's closer than I thought though. The audi wins out in this department primarily because of better packaging and design and not materials as I would have expected.

**Engine/Drivetrain/Exhaust**  
The RS3 engine is more special. Period. It feels smoother yet more characterful, revs higher and pops shifts off with a porsche like intensity. The sound both inside and outside the cabin is nicer. It's more harmonious and special sounding vs the blackwing which has way more pops bangs and crackles accentuating a normal sounding engine. It also pulls hard and returns better MPG than the blackwing.( 27MPG VS 18MPG on my typical commute). Turbo lag especially at low RPM seems a little worse on the RS3 than the blackwing but it's marginal. The manual in the blackwing makes a huge difference in engagement though, a manual is just way more engaging in-spite of how good the DSG in the RS3 is. It also helps that the manual is an excellent tremec unit with excellent rev matching and no-lift shifting.

**Daily driving(commute etc)**  
I think the RS3 wins this round- Its smaller yet more practical, more efficient and interior is nicer for just relaxing in. The ride is definitely better on the blackwing but it's not a massive advantage, the RS3 rides pretty well in its comfort setting too(it has adjustable dampers). The adaptive cruise is awesome and I think the stereo(B&O) is a little better than the blackwing's AKG's. It might also be slightly quieter road noise wise inside.

**Canyon carving/enthusiastic driving**  
The big one and why we primarily bought both car. I drove them back to back on my favorite twisties at 8/10ths out here and I had loads of fun in both cars. The manual blackwing is clearly more engaging and I definitely prefer it but the DSG with paddles is not too far behind. The RS3 tries hard to feel like a rear wheel drive car. You can feel the car rotating and simulating a RWD car the best it can. It does not feel as natural as the blackwing but its close and fun in a different way. One area the blackwing absolutely trounces the RS3 is steering feel. The RS3 has none. I drove a porsche after the blackwing and the blackwing's steering feel is closer to the porsche than the RS3 i.e. in a different league. Overall, I prefer the blackwing but it's closer than you think and I think the manual plays a big part.

I have not driven the RS3 on the track but have done the track experience which Cadillac provides and the blackwing was excellent on the track. I can't imagine the RS3 matching it when going flat out on a track- the ride and handling at the limit in the blackwing are a step above the RS3.

**Conclusion**  
So, my criterion when ordering my blackwing were manual, RWD, 4 doors and special(not too popular, limited numbers etc). If I had room for just one car and I did not track my cars the RS3 is quite a good choice vs a blackwing. Especially if you don't want a manual a RS3 might even edge the blackwing out.",cars

Brilliant, but, I’m sure pricey to do. Leave it to the Germans!

TIA for your advice!

EDIT: Well this certainly lit up more than I thought it would! 

Thanks for all of your replies, from the snarky and sarcastic (in true Reddit form 😁) to the truly helpful, I appreciate folks taking the time.

I was hoping for a better solution, but the best one is the simplest: get out and wipe the water off the lens. Not ideal when it’s pouring rain outside, but hey, I’m gonna get out of the car anyway!

I’ve been driving for 47 years, and it’s really only fairly recently that cars are being designed so you really can’t see right behind them - no head-swiveling nor mirror use helps. Well, I had a 1941 Plymouth Coupe that you couldn’t see behind either, but that’s another story.",cars

With combustion cars, drivetrain losses are usually quoted to be about 15% for RWD and 20% for AWD. I haven’t seen any figure quoted or any mention of drivetrain losses with EVs but they do deliver power to the wheels more directly so I’m expecting the losses to be a lot lower.

399,1706598696.0,Custom Ordering Experiences per Manufacturer in Modern Times,"A common thread across the car world is that for enthusiast cars to actually exist (manuals, fun colors, etc..), the way to “vote” with automakers is to buy new. To take it one step further, the ideal way is to order an exact spec. However, there doesn’t seem to be a lot of documentation that compares the actual ordering experience and timelines for new cars across manufacturers and geographies.

I can start with Jeep orders in the USA, since I took delivery of a Wrangler last week. Some dealers are more accustomed to (and willing) to submit customer orders, so I purchased from a dealer a few states away that does high volume order business with discounts. The dealer was super straightforward and knowledgeable on pricing and options available for order, but required a $1000 non-refundable deposit to submit that’s credited towards the sales price. 

I submitted the order in April 2023. Jeep was affected by the strike in fall 2023, and Jeep also did not produce any manual 2024s until November/December of last year. Mine was finally delivered to the dealer in mid-January, and I picked it up last week. On JL Wrangler forums, timing reported has all over the map; from roughly a month from order to delivery, to over 9 months (like my order) for less common options such as the manual transmission or half doors. Jeep gives decent transparency to order progress through its “pizza tracker,” although the underlying data is imperfect.

How about other manufacturers?",cars

As big of a market as Houston is, I would’ve thought anyone & everyone would want to be there to show off their upcoming vehicles. Granted I will just be looking at this from a car perspective as the boats were neat to look at, but wasn’t my main focus on going there.

Some of the biggest shockers from my perspective as a casual person just going to enjoy the show:
- Where are all of the Stellantis products? No jeep, dodge, Chrysler, fiat, Ram???

- For those who also went… was I crazy, or did Ford just not have the new 2024 F-150s on display? Didnt see their new “pro-access” tailgate anywhere or the new headlight design. Seemed like a bunch of 2023 trucks.

- Hyundai Didn’t have their new Elantra-N or Ioniq-N which I was really hoping to see.

- No Audi, Mercedes, Or BMW? Massive German luxury car brands that easily should have been there as there is a big market for them.

- Maybe a bit of a stretch, but surprised not to see a EV section with Teslas, Rivians, Lucid for people to check out.

- i get that there are only minor differences in trims, but can we please just have all of the cars on the floor unlocked? Allows more people to see the ”same car” at the same time, and although the differences are minor, it is still nice to compare for those who are seriously considering between which trim meets their needs/wants.

- On a positive note, I was highly impressed with Lincolns display. That Nautilus was beautiful and those Wraps they had on them (that they actually offer through Lincoln) were stunning on the cars. At least in my Opinion. I know it’s not for everyone.

I’m sure there are large financial reasons for things being the way they were, but I would’ve hoped that an Auto show displaying all of the latest models coming out had just that. ALL of the new models coming out. These shows are a good way for buyers to look at all of their options they have been deciding between and coming to a conclusion on what purchase they want to make.",cars

427,1706299586.0,"When suffering tailgating in a single lane (cannot move over to let the bad driver pass), should you put your hazard lights on and smoothly/slowly decelerate to the speed at which their following distance is appropriate until you are able to to change lanes to let them pass? Know a better strategy?","Edit: The general consensus in answer to the question is ""decelerate slowly, move as far over as you can, and signal if possible for them to pass you"". It is remarkable how much hatred there is from Reddit users who don't read. I'm disabling inbox notifications now due to the hateful vitriol so many are posting.

***

Recently I was in a single-lane no-shoulder country road going the limit 55 mi/hr ~ 90 km/hr and a car began tailgating me at a distance appropriate for 25 mi/hr ~ 40 km/hr.

It was highly concerning, because if an animal ran into the road, or if an oncoming car swerved into my lane, or if I came across another hazard (e.g. an object fallen out of the back of a truck), I would be forced to either hit the object, run off the road, go into the oncoming traffic lane, or slam on brakes and probably get rear-ended. 

It seemed to me the best strategy would have been to turn on hazard lights and decelerate ~ 1 km/hr/s until the speed matched the car's following distance, so the bad driver behind me would be more likely to hit the brakes in time if I had to brake suddenly.

Of course, if the bad driver doesn't understand why I'm slowing, this risks triggering anger and road rage. In the USA this could even result in death, as [in some regions people will literally shoot you in your car on the highway](https://www.ecosia.org/search?&q=shot%20driving%20on%20Alabama%20highway).

Ultimately I decided to 'risk getting rear-ended' and continue driving the speed limit until I exited that single-lane portion of road several minutes later, weighing 'need to suddenly brake' vs 'firearm road range incident' as ""low v. unknown(great?)"".

What do you think of this strategy of hazard lights + slow deceleration to match the car's traveling distance? Should we look for a large magnetic bumper decal saying ""IF TAILGATING WILL SLOW"" to put on our car before such trips? 

In the future if it happens again I think there might be enough road to hazard-light, slow, pull to the side and they'll probably get the idea to swerve and pass me.

Curious to hear what you think of all this, and what the best strategy is.",cars

It definitely protects but at what cost? Considering that it looks like Thanos' lower jaw, I guess *everything.*

Probably a neat car to drive and enjoy, though. 80mm taller ride height than standard with Kalmar-spec springs and dampers.

It was just, hands down, one of my best memories ever. The class was fun, engaging, and best of all - at the end they let you loose. 

I've tried to recreate this at various places, one specific place being Exotics Racing in Las Vegas.

The instructor is ready to grab the wheel and slam the breaks at any moment.

One of the best things about the BMW driving school was the low stakes. If you lost control and slid off? Not a problem. There is no way to flip or crash on this course. They have a truck that can pull you out of anything if your wheels got too deep. Constantly skidding and absolutely shredding the tires on turns? No problem. It's all included in your base fare.

436,1706237087.0,"Saab's Product Brief for the 2010-11 9-5, Circa 2008","I found [this product brief](http://xn--teamgnter133-hlb.se/pdf/9650confidential.pdf) for the 9-5NG on 
[Marcus & Manuela's Saab Channel](https://youtu.be/WNKmone2mhI), estimated to be from either 2008 or 2009 and thought it was an interesting look into that vehicle, and how Saab and the industry thought at the time. I am not sure how often documents like this leak, but I thought it was interesting

[I happen to have a 2011 9-5](https://www.reddit.com/r/saab/comments/ysguap/dusk_by_the_bay/), so here's what jumped out at me:

1. Targeting the A6 as the first competitor, with the S80, 5-Series, RL, and M35 as secondary competitors. The 5-series feels out of scope but otherwise this seems like the right market for Saab to target, but underscores how badly they needed XWD to be truly competitive.
2. Saab identified ""adaptive headlights, radar-enabled collision warning, rollover control & protection, and high-performance headlights"" as the most desired features in the segment. The 9-5NG never got radar-enabled collision warning, but Saab did manage to develop some interesting adaptive headlight tech that we didn't get in the US for this car. Still, seems like an odd list of must-have features.
3. Saab felt that they would have a price advantage over the A6, which...I guess. But my car was $50k in 2011 with an 2.0T and FWD, so I don't think they hit this mark.
4. They really felt styling would be a big differentiator, and I think they were probably right, as I would say the 9-5NG still looks far newer than the benchmarked models listed.
5. A number of key features planned for MY11 never happened: adaptive cruise control and crash avoidance most notably. There's no mention of a rear view camera anywhere in this brief.
6. Saab was pretty critical of the HMI in all benchmarked cars - this was always a strength for Saab, and I think they hit the mark here.",cars

438,1706226859.0,I Bought a Used Brown Manual Wagon and Drove It 300 Miles Home,"A couple of pics of the Saab: https://imgur.com/a/uKRUjfB

I did what a lot of people say they would do but probably (and understandably) wouldn't: I bought a used wagon that was brown and came with a manual transmission. If you haven't read my flair by now, I bought a 2004 Saab 9-5 Aero wagon. Well okay, it's *actually* Espresso Black Metallic, but fulfilling the meme is funnier than saying that you bought a manual wagon on its own. This is the somewhat short story of how I ran into a beat-up Saab and promptly drove it from Southern Indiana to North Alabama.

Back in 2019, when I was searching for my first car, I had been looking at my options, which had included cars like the Chrysler PT Cruiser and the Lincoln Continental. I stumbled upon a 2001 Saab 9-5 SE wagon for sale about 25 miles away from where I lived. I should have inquired about it, but I wasn't ready to buy a car yet, and the car ultimately sold. I regretted it deeply enough to buy its cheaper American cousin, a 2004 Saturn L300 V6 wagon. That Saturn left so much of an impression on me that I HAD to search for the real thing. 

In early 2022, electronic issues with my Saturn forced me to buy a car to replace that. Wanting something that would actually be reliable, I would end up buying a 2006 Mercury Montego Premier. But the lingering thought of having a fun car would continue to run through my mind. More specifically, the thought of having a Saab 9-5 kept lingering on. In late 2022, I would get to drive a 2005 Saab 9-5 Aero wagon. That experience told me that I needed to get one. It felt like my Saturn but nicer in every way - and that's exactly what I wanted out of it.

Fast forward to the end of 2023. I finally moved in with my boyfriend in a new apartment, I have some disposable income and I have room for a second car. I had just learned the very basics of driving a car with a manual transmission courtesy of my uncle and his 2003 Honda Accord EX-V6 coupe. That experience was daunting, but it had me wanting more. More shifting, more power, more... cool than a 2006 Mercury Montego. And so the hunt for a somewhat peppy front-wheel drive car with a manual transmission began. V6 Honda Accords and Nissan Altimas, Volvo S70 T5s, 6-speed Nissan Maximas, even Chrysler PT Cruiser GTs were being looked at. But then, a listing of a 2004 Saab 9-5 Aero came up. The seller only wanted to trade, but I shot my shot anyways. After deciding that he was too impatient to wait for trades, he was willing to take cash. 

There was just one problem: a bad snowstorm hit a lot of the United States and it was quite icy in the parts of Alabama it had hit. Hoping that it would get better, I kept the seller updated on whether or not I would be able to check the car out. Thankfully, the roads in Alabama improved enough to where I could actually make the drive from North Alabama to Southern Indiana. After spending a night in a hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, my boyfriend and I set sail to a state I had never driven in. 

As it turns out, I was looking at a relatively rough Saab, but one that still ran and drove. I had a short fight with my mind and after breaking out my wallet, I decided that I was going to go through with buying this car. I knew in my heart that I had always wanted one, and that a car that was both what I wanted **and** had a stick was worth the trouble, whatever it would be. And so I got to get a little acclimated to driving a stick shift car, even if I kept stalling out in first gear. 

But all throughout the drive, I just kept thinking to myself about how I *finally* made 19-year old me happy. I accomplished a goal that I had wanted to satisfy since I had wanted a car: I got a Saab 9-5. It may be rusty and it needs some work done before I can say that it's nice, but I'm happy to have it.",cars

440,1706213231.0,"It's not you, it's me. Saying goodbye to my Alfa Romeo 4C.","I've written about my 4C [before on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/y1ojf2/one_year_with_the_terrible_and_wonderful_alfa/), and i'm very thankful for the reception those posts have received. I've also had about a dozen prospective owners of the 4C reach out to me for advice, experiences, and just to chat about my experience with the car - and thats something id continue to be happy to do.

The 4C was an object of obsession long before purchasing it, and I am left with a lot of complicated feelings after saying goodbye to it. The 4C isn't a car you come into ""on the fence"" about, it's not something that you cross shop with other cars and end up in something else. Everyone I know who owns one literally *only* looked for a 4C.

In that sense - the 4C is kind of like a piece of your identity, where what the car *represents* is infinitely more important than what it *is.*

If you want the kind of experience that the 4C is known to provide then *absolutely still get one*. But over the past couple of years, my desires for a sports car have changed - and I don’t really have the ability to keep two around. Most of us don’t have a warehouse to keep every car we’ve ever bought in storage - just the garages of our memories, and I’m always going to be thankful I got to add it to mine.

A good friend of mine said about the 4C: ""This car is like a bad high school boyfriend, while you are young you are obsessed with what that person is, and claw into it like its about to run away from you. In retrospect you realize how terrible you we're for each other, even if you have a lot of good memories with them. This car is a guaranteed coming of age story no matter how old you are""

Why I sold it:

**I want to become a better driver**.

I think it’s hard to become a better driver without a venue to explore a car at and beyond the limits of adhesion. The 4Cs limits are high-ish, and past the limits it’s a little hairy, like with most mid-engined cars.

**I want to go to more tracks across the US**

It doesn’t matter how good the car is *on* the track if you wouldn’t drive it there. About 250 miles is my limit in the 4C. There’s also definitely not enough space to bring spares, or tools, or luggage. There aren’t any trailer hitches available like there is for the Elise.

**I wanted to be able to drive it to more places and do more things with it.**

The best sports car is the one you have with you, and for most of the past 2 years, that had been a 2015 Honda Fit, because that’s the only car that could more than 3 pairs of underwear and a sock. Not to mention the *punishing* ride of the 4C means my Fiancé was *not* a fan of going anywhere in the 4C, especially not anywhere 1+ hour away.

Not to mention the long wait times on some 4C parts - waited 3 months for a new $4000 windshield.

I of course knew of all of the shortcomings of the 4C when I bought it, but what I want out of a sports car has changed over time. It really boils down to that a sports car you drive is better than a sports car you don’t, and ill have more reasons and opportunities to drive my GR86 than I ever did with the 4C.

But ill always remember the 4C, and i'm sure in a couple of years ill look back on it through rose-tinted glasses and forget all of the pain of owning one, and just see that beautiful car on a gorgeous summer morning in a canyon road.

Maybe that's where an Alfa Romeo is best experienced, in the memories of a younger, more romantic version of yourself.

If so, ill always love my 4C.",cars

It might have started life as a 2000s Ford Ranger, Nissan Frontier, Toyota Tacoma, or another light truck. But it was completely stripped down to the chassis save for the doors, mirrors, & sides of the truck beds. But the doors & truck bed sides were the same color, no mismatch so it wasn't something picked out of the junkyard. And it was all clean.

It had clean tires, shiny retro hubcaps with a lowered suspension. The lights were not original to it & soldered onto the chassis while perfectly aligned with each other as if it was under manufacturer specs. Same goes for the tail lights. It had a custom wooden lining holding stuff above the bed. 

Everything was too aligned, too clean to be a poor man's junkheap. It was like it was purposely modified to fit this aesthetic. I want to say a modern version of rat rods, but it seemed too clean & symmetric to be specifically one. It definitely wasn't like the Miata on the wiki.",cars

I'm sure the Elise is a great car for people who really want what it uniquely offers. Even I wanted one many years ago because everyone talks about how pure the driving experience is, the lightness, communication, etc. 

It took me years to realize that few cars would be worse for me than the Elise. The same could be said of most enthusiast cars: Miata, 911, Corvette to name a few. Each offers a fairly specific experience that won't work for most people, yet people who've never driven them lust after them because of tales and legend. It makes me wonder how many enthusiasts don't know what they actually like about cars and what combination of characteristics work for them uniquely, but only want the specific cars they do because they've been told to. 

Personally, after years of putting up with the compromises of the Miata I realized I want a relatively plush and isolated driving experience that's aided heavily by technology. Those things are sacrilege to most enthusiasts which is probably part of why it took me so long to realize that's what I want. How does everyone else decide what cars they lust after?",cars

I’m 33 now and I am officially done dealing with and trying to modify cars. 

I’ve done everything from full bolt ons, to forged internal built motors, adding boost to NA motors, larger turbos etc. I’ve modified German, Japanese and American cars. I have easily spent over 6 figures in modifications over the last 17 years.

The reason I am done is because it’s become clear to me that if I want a faster car that, in the long run, it is far more economical and trouble free to just spend the money and purchase a car with the power that you want instead of trying to modify a car to reach your power goals.

When you modify a car there is always something breaking and trying to fix a modified car is far more difficult than trouble shooting a car that has all OEM parts.

It gets to the point to where you don’t even enjoy driving the car anymore when the CEL can and will come on frequently and the car can be out of commission for weeks or months and if it’s beyond your ability to fix it a normal shop doesn’t even want to touch it so you have to go to an expensive speed shop to have it fixed.

This has been my experience with every car I have modded and I am just over it. 

The final straw for me was a 2018 Camaro SS I purchased a couple months ago. The car had 3,600 miles on it and was the exact spec vehicle I wanted. It came with full bolt ons which consisted of long tube headers, an upgraded intake manifold, throttle body and intake. I wanted a stock vehicle but this one was the right price and exactly what I wanted for the color, options, interior etc so I went into this knowing I will probably go back to stock. The car throws lean codes and I cannot even register it because the emissions systems will not turn on due to the codes. I’ve put the stock cats and exhaust manifolds back on and tuned the emissions systems back on. Still throwing lean codes. All the fuel trims are perfectly normal, I’ve done a smoke test and there are no leaks. I’ve now purchased all OEM parts and am converting it all back to stock. I haven’t even been able to enjoy this car and I can’t wait to bring it back to completely stock. If the issue persists I will just bring it to my local Chevy dealership and have them troubleshoot it like a normal car and I guarantee it will be sorted out within a few days.

Has anyone else dealt with this as they’ve gotten older and just threw in the towel on trying to modify cars?",cars

476,1706009594.0,The story behind me Supercharging and installing a Speeduino on a Subaru Libero Kei Van,"***tl;dr*** *i am now in a good place in my life and i can restore and modify a kei van*

Hey guys, I usually don't tend to make text posts, but now it felt like the right moment to do that. I just need to get things off my chest as to what I feel about this project, what led to it, and recent changes in my life that allowed me to get back to it.

When I was a teenager (14-15 I believe), my family used to own a bunch of Subaru Libero E10 vans (based on the fourth generation Subaru Sambar platform). Around this time, I started forming a love for cars, and obscure 90s cars in particular. Fast forward a couple of years, never really touching a car in my life and driving my parents Daihatsu for a good amount of 4 years, I decided to buy a car. Unfortunately that car was a 2006 Opel Astra hatchback.

That was my first interaction with a ""modern"" car, and what got my click for cars back into action. That car was terrible, it had wiring looms randomly snap to pieces, plastics disintegrating and a failing cooling system. I took the DIY approach with it, and just got the parts and dug into work. but all efforts were futile, because one day it just refused to start, and I got it towed to the junkyard.

Shortly before it was towed, I found a 1995 Suzuki Swift 3-door hatchback for sale (Geo Metro, or Chevy Sprint for the americans out there). This car really kicked-started something with my passion about cars. I disassembled that car twice, to then completely assemble it back. It taught me about headgaskets, compression, the concept of injection vs carburetor, driveline, ECU and car electronics. As well as being hell fun to drive, with it's 3cyl 1000cc engine. I drove it for two and a half years until the engine block couldn't be saved (it had rotten out by all the tap water used in it over the years).

I then drove my parents car until I found a mint condition stock BMW E36 318i, which has a whole story behind it, but I'll spare the details. That car was and still is great, and it is my daily driver for over 5 years already.

During the last five years I developed a kick for motorcycles, so I got myself a 250cc single cylinder and 500cc twin street motorcycles. The 250cc one is disassembled to pieces in my parents yard, while the 500cc one has its gas tank removed with the carburetors, until I can find some motivation to do something about them.

Two years into owning the E36, I saw a facebook marketplace ad for a Subaru Libero E12 kei van. This is where the real trouble started. I informed my dad that I am about to purchase yet another automobile, and at first he didn't like the idea, but after I showed him what I'm getting, he told me to go for it. I didn't think twice, I called my buddy, got a stack of cash, and went down to get the car.

It was in a really rough shape, completely dirty, the interior completely trashed and abused, and one of the side covers for the bumper was a piece of plastic jug cut to fit. The owner told me that the engine has just been rebuilt about a month ago, and that in about 150km i should tighten the head to spec.Long story short, I drove the car for about a year, and then the exhaust was probably blocked or something, but I couldn't drive it any more, it had severe power loss, and the exhaust manifold got red hot in one particular drive, causing the wiring and some electric components in the engine back and distributor to melt.

I had a short downfall in my life, I won't go into much details, but i guess it involves the generic things that get is down in life. self-fulfillment, relationships and growing up (physically and emotionally).

Recently, some things changed for the better (after objectively being in the worst place that they've been), and I get to fulfill many of the goals and wants that I had over the years. One of them being the Libero Van, which I also got during the worse part of my life. It signifies everything that I stand for in a way, and I believe that It's a test to my skills and beliefs nowadays.

I started researching how to make this car in it's most absolute best shape, specifically the engine. I decided that the order of action would be to clean the engine, work on the cooling system, swap the mechanical A/C with an electric one, re-wire all the electronics, add a supercharger, and use a trigger wheel instead of a distributor with COP type coils, connected to a Speeduino ECU. It's going to be a journey, and I hope that I can finish it by the time spring arrives.I try to document most of it, and I will probably post a full video of the series on YouTube or something, I did make a couple of videos, but now I'm kind of regretting posting them, as it gives me too much leeway in not working on the car.

Have you ever felt something about a car that made it one of the most important things in moving you forward in life?

When I look at all the current cars, especially stuff like the new high end hybrids, I can't imagine it will be possible to keep that stuff working a couple decades from now. Off the top of my head, here are some of the things we know will age horribly, or reach an unusable state: hybrid/ev batteries, screens, software, safety equipment. Probably the worst offender I've recently seen is Mercedes, their high end hybrid systems are needlesly complicated to the point of absurd. Doesn't this mean we're in for another ecological disaster when we have to scrap pretty much all the cars we currently make once they reach their best due date?

Despite them being drastically safer to drive with, I never once received an insurance discount or incentive from my provider to use them.

510,1705768322.0,What are some cars that have more horsepower than stated?,"So for years I've heard that some cars (mostly the 90s jdm sports cars that had ""276 horsepower"" actually had 300+ in reality) claim a certain amount of power,but in reality the car had more. 

We already know there's no way the jdm cars only had ""276 horsepower"" because as seen on Best Motoring(but it's questionable as they make it clear that they are biased towards JDM cars) the ""276 horsepower"" R32 GTR was able to keep up with the 911 (964)Turbo 3.3 which had 316hp/235kw. The R33 GTR which also had ""276 horsepower"" kept up with the 402 horsepower 911(993)Turbo. No way could 276 horsepower put up a fight to a car with 400+ horses. Even the NSX-R could keep up with the Ferrari F40

 Besides the jdm cars and the cars I list below,what are some cars that claimed a low number but had more horsepower than stated

The ones I know of are:

Ferrari F40.Ferrari claims the F40 makes 478 horsepower but dyno tests show it makes very close to if not more than 500 horses,which might explain why it's faster than the F50

Nissan GTR R32 Skyline,it was the first GTR to have ""276 horsepower"",but according to Doug Demuro it actually put out 320 horsepower 

F10 M5,it's stated to have very close to 600 horses 

Toyota Century,like most jdm cars, it claimed 276 horses but the V12 sedan had well over 300 horses 

Porsche 959,though it's a rumor,many think it had 500+ horses from the factory

521,1705691743.0,Will Crossovers & SUVs Ever Get the Minivan Treatment? What Comes Next?,"In the early to mid-2000s, minivans gained significant popularity. However, a shift occurred over time as people gravitated towards larger crossovers and SUVs. This change was driven by a desire to distance themselves from the stereotypical 'mom car' image associated with minivans, which had become commonplace. Fast forward to the present day, and school pickup lines are now filled with Highlanders, Suburbans, and Explorers – the very vehicles chosen to avoid the previously perceived stereotype.

  
Considering this cycle, there's a potential pattern where each generation rejects the mainstream vehicles of the previous generation to assert their uniqueness. If this trend continues, the question arises: what will be the next preferred vehicle type? Will the cycle come full circle, leading to a resurgence of minivans? Could station wagons make an unexpected comeback? Alternatively, will automakers continue evolving crossovers, creating diverse versions of the same vehicle in different sizes?

Autocar's comparison. This is the most direct GT comparison I've ever seen a publication do. IMO these cars are very close in terms of where on the comfort/sportiness spectrum they are. Basically they're the sportiest of the GTs. Notes from the video:

DB12: lots of mechanical noise, road noise, wind noise, engine noise, just a noisy cabin. Sport+ mode is harsh. Steering is a bit vague, DB11 and DB9 were better. Not very sophisticated, more like a muscle car. Feels like an AMG GT.

Maserati GranTurismo: comfortable, compliant ride, isolated in comfort mode, Prior doesn't like air suspension (in general). In Corsa the car is still comfortable, V6 engine doesn't sound great (no surprise), makes noise not music. The AWD feels rear-biased so it drives more like a RWD car with extra grip.

Ferrari Roma
Guttural, sophisticated, rich engine note, but not as good as the DB12. Better comfort than the DB12 but less than the Granturismo. Lots of road feel, agility, engagement, involvement. Quick, precise steering. Feels nervous and twitchy on long sweepers, better for tighter roads. Cocooning interior, sophisticated chassis, better than the DB12.

Conclusion

Long drive: Maserati

Open winding road: Roma

Open winding road when you want to feel burly: DB12

My thoughts: 

DB12: sounds like an AMG which makes sense since it's an AMG engine. The interior is much improved, it actually looks like a nice place to be now. But the satnav is unacceptable. Prior said it's a full quarter mile behind the car so you get instructions to turn long after you passed the turn.

Maserati GranTurismo: this one is growing on me *really* quickly. I wasn't too keen on it when Throttle House reviewed it, but it has a lot going for it IMO. Adaptive air ride, the customizable digital clock is a nice touch, I like how the seats look (would pass on the recycled fishing nets though), you can fit people in the back, it's still pretty despite only subtle changes to the 15 year old car(Pininfarina is forever). I'm seriously interested in the electric Folgore version of this car. It has 3 motors and does proper torque vectoring and apparently will have a 4 wheel drift mode for when you need new tires anyway and want to go out with a bang.

My thoughts: I think the Roma has an identity crisis. The steering suggests sports car, but the suspension suggests comfort. [Henry Catchpole](https://youtu.be/As-a09S0Qlc?t=618) mentioned that it causes a mismatch in your head about what the experience should be.",cars

For those who don’t know, GM put a 3.8 L supercharged V6 in a lot of normal looking sedans back in the early 2000’s and the supercharger it came with can be bought pretty cheaply at around $100. You can then get an adaptor plate, belt and intake manifold and put it onto a 4.8/5.3 LS and make 500 horsepower with the right pulleys and fuel system.

This one that he tests in the video above is a Gen 3 blower, which isn’t quite as powerful as the gen 5 blower but still makes respectable power.

565,1705458271.0,"I had a Kei Car, and it didn't suck","This is my final update on [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/xu3rg7/i_bought_a_kei_car/) The [second update](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/10gpqi1/four_months_of_kei_ownership/) was posted four months later, and marked my fourth month of ownership. 

In October 2022, I picked up a kei car, a 1996 Subaru Vivio Bistro, that I had ordered earlier that year. After more than a year of ownership, I can say definitively that I could have done way worse. 

The car has not been expensive to own, but it is also not possible to fix anything major if anything major goes wrong. While things like the engine and transmission are around and the parts can be acquired, things like body parts are not available in the US, and nobody is willing to ship them in for a reasonable price. Which brings me to my first point:

1. It held up well in two car crashes. Three, technically, but one of them was so minor I couldn't tell you where the point of impact was. My wife got hit twice in this car, both times on the (US) passenger side front. The fender is crumpled, the hood split open and folded back, and the front bumper missing. The first one was her fault, the second one, not so much. Second time, she got hit by a truck. The car drove away both times, and the steering geometry remains unaffected, but the second time something important got knocked loose, and the bright (there's only one headlight now) is stuck on. I tried to price out a replacement set of bodywork, and while the hood, fender, and front bumper are all really cheap by themselves, they would have to be shipped in by air freight (if they can be shipped at all) and that would cost a couple thousand just to get the parts in. At that stage, I gave up. I was having trouble getting my other cars (both of which were US market cars) repaired and I figured that the little thing still ran and drove well, and I didn't need the aggravation. 
2. The speakers, all two of them, are blown. This wouldn't be an issue for anybody who gave half a damn, but after the first accident, I stopped caring. I had stopped driving it at that point and my wife doesn't really listen to the radio, so I wasn't going to spend any amount of my time sourcing speakers to replace the blown ones for a car that was already totaled. 
3. The (JP) passenger window stopped working properly. My dad and I had to jump the switch to get it to roll up, at which point I just left the switch disconnected. Not like we needed that window anyway. Probably not an issue for somebody who cares, but as I said, I stopped caring when half its face got torn off. 

Beyond these three points, ownership has actually been positive. Maintenance is easy to do yourself, and despite two car crashes and a number of minor problems, it's been reliable. It still starts every time, and it's still fun to drive, even if I have to look over a twisted hood to do it now. It worked out so well initially that I opted to buy another Japanese car for my daily use, and that has worked out well too, but there's nothing particularly interesting to report about that one. 

I have owned worse cars. The Subaru was not suited to highway use, and it was prone to unwanted attention, but it ran well and would work great for anybody who intends to use it for its original purpose: a small, fuel-efficient city car. But it's not going to work if you have to go on the highway for long periods, and you're not going to have much fun driving it on road trips. It struggles with hills and any modern four-cylinder car will return better gas mileage. I've enjoyed my time with it, and I'm sorry it's had such a hard time in America. I'll miss it, and if I were in the right place, I'd buy another one and do it all over again. I'm saying goodbye on Sunday, when my brother will come haul it away and hopefully enjoy it half as much as I did. ",cars

575,1705410328.0,Neutral throttle-disable safety feature?,"I’m on a number of car pages on Facebook, and a few people have posted the same story.

They’re sitting in their vehicle, revving the engine a bit to warm it up faster (yes, I know, but that’s not the issue I’m curious about, I already know that’s dumb)… and then eventually their throttle stops responding.

They can shift gears and the vehicle will move under idle, but the throttle does nothing until they restart, at which point everything is normal. 

My theory is that this is a safety feature. Say you’re sitting in your car, engine running, waiting for something… and you fall asleep. Foot goes onto the accelerator pedal and pushes it to the floor. Your engine revs until it overheats, and eventually the car even catches fire. There’s plenty of videos out there of this very thing happening. 

But, I’ve never heard of such a safety feature. Granted I’ve been out of a shop environment for a decade now so I’m not entirely up to speed… yet I was thinking, maybe on drive by wire vehicles, if the computer recognizes that you’re revving too much in park or neutral, it disables the accelerator pedal input to prevent you from “dead footing” yourself into an incident?

Have any of you heard of such a safety feature,  or is it more likely that something’s wrong with these people’s cars?",cars

**TLDR** My 10 year old Cayman with 12,000 more miles than the C8 and 175 less horsepower feels like a better car

Car timeline: daily'd a 2005 Mustang GT for 25,000 miles, 4 years. Replaced with a 2014 Cayman S 1.5 years ago, have put 12,000 miles on it so far. 5 track days, several long roadtrips to the mountains with backpacking gear. Stock except for track brake pads, a mild mod to existing mufflers, and a GT3 steering software upgrade.

When the C8 was revealed in 2019, I was a broke college kid who was obsessing over it and it definitely became one of my dream cars, the spec sheet and feature set was just too hard to ignore. Why buy anything else at even twice the price? When my Mustang started overheating 1.5 years ago, I put a deposit down on a C8 but realized there was a year long wait, so I started obsessively hunting for my next daily. I landed on a 2014 Cayman S and held out for a good spec. But I've been twiddling my thumbs about my C8 deposit since then so I decided to finally rent a C8 and figure out if it's worth the roughly $30-40k premium I'd pay over the Cayman.

I had the car for 48 hours, 300 miles. I did only 20ish miles of highway driving, the rest was on windy Bay Area backroads. Woke up at 6am both days to beat traffic. I clocked roughly 8 hours of seat time. It was in base spec, no options. After finishing with the C8 I jumped straight into my 981 and hit a backroad to get some contrasting thoughts.


**Interior**

 As soon as I got in the car I was a little disappointed by the fit and finish. The leather, especially on the steering wheel, definitely doesn't feel as nice as my Cayman. The turn stalks, all the buttons, etc. all also felt much cheaper than the Cayman. Was a bit of a let down since I read so many reviews about the C8's interior being ""grown up"". 

After 300 miles I didn't like the big divide in the middle. The Cayman's cabin feels more spacious without it and being able to interact with my passenger on longer roadtrips is an underrated aspect I think I'd miss.

The seating position was disappointing as well. I couldn't get as low as I wanted to in the C8, while in my Cayman it lets me get low enough to where my shoulder is below the windowsill, which is great for feeling the chassis. 

The trunk space is less usable on the C8 as well. The frunk is smaller than the Cayman and I was hoping to be able to fit two 50L packs for backpacking in the trunk, but the dimensions are too weird. The Cayman can fit 3 no problem. 

Also my first time using Apple CarPlay. Was slow, buggy, lacked features. Didn't care for it. Much prefer just mounting my phone to the dash on my Cayman. I turn the touchscreen off when I'm driving anyways. The analogue tach from the Cayman is something I really missed as well, the main screen had way too much going on. 

**Steering** 

The steering in Touring mode immediately felt really disconnected and loose, I felt like I was playing one of those arcade racing games. As a tourer, this is great but it was so jarring coming from a high performance coupe. I drove it 3 miles to my garage and parked it, waiting for the next day. 

Set out 6AM to beat traffic and set out towards the Bay Area hills. Once on the road, I realized that I had to put the car in ""Track"" to enjoy the steering at all. But all ""Track"" did was make it really tight, the arcade sensation was still there. No feedback from the road or variation in the way the wheel loads up. I proceeded to drive in Track for almost all 300 miles. 

In contrast, my Cayman's steering is light at center and loads up incredibly through turns. I will mention that I can't remember what stock Cayman was like, but I remember it weighing up quite well into the corners as well. There is a good amount of feedback from the road compared to the C8, but obviously nothing compared to a hydraulic rack. I missed the C8's weightless steering just a tiny bit when I first got in my Cayman again and was navigating through some tight city blocks, but forgot about it within 2 minutes. 

**Noise**

IThe engine and cabin noise of the C8 is hands down the most disappointing aspect of it. My 20 year old Mustang had more theatre than this car. I remember the first 3 miles I was thinking ""did they swap out the V8 in this one?"" There is almost no engine or exhaust noise in the cabin EVEN AT REDLINE. Corvette should sell its sound deadening technology to the military because it's nuts. I kept the targa top off for about 250 of those 300 miles and it was only barely passable then. 

Overall the engine sounds alright. At city speeds and low RPMs it sounds like a truck which is a bit meh. Maybe it's the exhaust/cabin setup but pulling to redline just doesn't induce much emotion. As soon as I hopped back in the Cayman the amount and kinds of cabin and exhaust noises as soon as you pass 3,000 RPM felt better than the C8 at any RPM. My #1 complaint about the Cayman is how long 2nd gear can be, but I quickly ate those words when I realized how soulless the C8 sounded while going through its shorter gears. 

An underrated aspect of the PDK is the kinds of noises the car makes during its razor sharp upshifts, it sounds great under load. Maybe the  C8 makes similar noises, but I'll never know because I could hear absolutely nothing in the cabin.  

**Brakes**

The stock brakes didn't inspire confidence on the C8. Compared to my Cayman, the initial bite was much later than I expected and I had to mash them to get what I wanted out of them. This is really where I felt the additional 700lb of weight from the chassis as well. In contrast, with the Cayman the initial bite is much earlier and the brakes feel much more linear. The track pads definitely contribute to the Cayman's favor as well but overall brake feel left a lot to be desired on the Corvette. 

**Performance**

The C8 is obviously really capable. The chassis and suspension was the highlight of the car, on the twisties I pushed it as hard as I push my Cayman and it had much more to give. I found some understeer right at the limit, but I'd expect about the same from my Cayman. With the Cayman I can induce some body roll but couldn't with the C8. Even in pretty wet conditions, the car hooked with little issues. Every time the rear end gave out a bit it was really easy to catch, where the Cayman feels a little more dicey when that happens. The transmission was great, as good as my PDK. A bit clunky at times at lower speeds, but so is the PDK.

The horsepower is absolutely a bit too much for the road and is kind of disappointing. At least with my Cayman I get to hear it sing for a little while longer when I'm doing an on-ramp pull or pulling out of a corner, while with the C8 I'm at go-to-jail speeds without any theatre. I also feel the sensation of speed and the G forces on the chassis of the Cayman significantly more through turns. With the C8, I feel absolutely nothing. Even on highway pulls at full throttle, the Cayman was way more thrilling than the C8 and pushed me back in my seat more. With the C8 it was more looking down at the speedometer and going ""cool, I'm at 100 now"". 

**Styling**

I thought the C8 looked dope from the start but after living with it for a while the way the rear fenders flare out and up started to bother me. Looks a bit peacocky compared to the lines of my 981. I will say the C8 commanded a ton of road presence. Cars would move out of my way on backroads 100ft+ ahead of me as soon as they saw me in the rearview which was nice. I'm not one for attention so I like how the Cayman flies under the radar (everyone owns a Porsche in the Bay) but is still a conversation starter with enthusiasts.

**Targa Top**

This deserves its own section because it was the best part of driving the C8. It was my first time driving with no roof and I looooved it. I took the top off 50 miles in and kept it off. When I woke up at 6am for day 2 I donned my winter toque and down jacket just so I could keep the roof off. This tells me a Boxster might be in my future but the Cayman is more practical as a do-it-all daily as long as I own a single car. 

Fun two days, but I'm happy to be back in my Cayman. I think I'm going to keep this car for a long time. I came in with high expectations as somebody with a soft spots for V8s since I really loved my Mustang, but walked away disappointed. The C8 is absolutely a fantastic car, but I think the Cayman is just a bit better. 

This was also a cheap lesson for me to not believe the hype about the next latest greatest thing or take everything I read at face value. ",cars

It seems the only EV company really making any money is Tesla. This got me thinking. There was a raging battle between EV companies and ICE companies looking to cross over, but did hybrids sneak in and win? 

Dealer support for EVs was also lacklustre. Turns out EVs requiring less servicing, which is great for the consumer but not for the dealer. They make a sizeable chunk of change from their service centres. Turns out this is actually more than they make from selling cars. 
 
It seems like hybrids are the winning model. They don’t require large downtimes to charge, they have a long range and don’t require road trips to be planned around charging stations. 

In my opinion, hybrids are the winner. But a temporary one while we sort the gaps in EV technology.

The new name? Evo. This is sure to not only make the car quicker by reducing the weight of letters, but that weight is also located high on the deck lid and in the glove compartment; the lower cG is an incredible triumph of engineering made necessary by trademark laws.

HWA has called their restomod a ""furious reinterpretation."" It features ""snazzier lights"" according to Pistonheads, and ""state-of-the-art"" technology. It probably also has ""horsepower,"" ""torque,"" and ""grip"" but nowhere in the news blurb are those mentioned; this author apologizes for editorializing.

They will be producing only 100 examples starting at 714,000 Euros each, the equivalent of approximately 800,000 Fantas bought in bulk at Lidl. Approximately 800,000 bulk Fantas equals 782,200USD, or 4 Dyson vacuums.

HWA is collaborating with Miami-based Curated for sales and distribution. This is an excellent choice, as Curated also collaborates with itself according to its home page, cementing its ability to collaborate. 

Miami, Florida is known worldwide for its sales and distribution network, mostly due to the documentary series *Miami Vice.*

If you'd like to know more about the HWA Evo, you can click on [this link for the PistonHeads article](https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-germancars/furious-hwa-evo-edges-closer-to-reality/48042) or [this link for HWA's own press release](https://www.hwaag.com/en/news-en/822-hwa-evo-the-revival-of-a-motorsport-classic-as-a-unique-customer-car.html). If you want to know more about the powertrain, however, you're just going to have to wait because that's, like, a secret right now.

HWA included an easter egg for its diehard fans: if you print the pictures, you now have your very own carbon fiber Evo.

I am not really a fan of that. Im more of a clean build person. 

The a6 is black with some chrome details. That colour combination is something I am going for. It also has a nice interior with a Bose sound system.

So what are some good not too expensive mods that I can do to it?

As an example i mean white fender blinkers or  some nice center caps with white details.

Its already quite low and it got some nice wheels so that is not necessary.

667,1704818714.0,How much money (if any) EV ownership saves depends on where you live,"Interesting article I came across recently, basically the upshot is that whether or not an EV costs less than an ICE (total cost of ownership over 25 years) depends on which city you live in, whether you can charge at home, and whether you get time-of-use discounts on power rates.

https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1141944_how-much-money-ev-ownership-saves-depends-on-where-you-live

Some takeaways I found interesting:

* If you can charge at home, even in the worst-case cities the total cost of ownership of an EV is only slightly worse than an ICE.

* If you can't charge at home an EV is usually the most expensive option.

* In most cities a hybrid is currently the cheapest option in terms of overall cost of ownership.",cars

Steering adjustments via software are clearly possible within the car as manufacturers adjust the weighting when switching drive modes. And even the same racks will have better/worse tuning in different cars. I believe some Porsche's have an EPS tuning swap that is done in the aftermarket. So why isn't it more ubiquitous?

706,1704561720.0,Picked up a 2022 Camaro 2SS 1LE,"I've been wanting to get back into a manual since I sold my last ones to get my Z06. I've always liked the 6th gen Camaro and I've owned a '16 V6 RS and a '19 ZL1 1LE before so I know what to expect. 

Since the end of production announcement I tried to get a new one locally but unfortunately when my allocation came up the manual wasn't available.

I found this used 2SS and a new 1SS at another dealer a few weeks ago. The extra options of the 2SS and the 1LE package sold me on it for not that much more over the '24.

My ideal spec would've been this car in Red with the PDR and no sunroof but the pickings are slim for Camaro's these days. The car itself is painted Satin Steel and besides the sunroof there isn't any other options except for what the 2SS and 1LE package adds.

The original owner thought it be a good idea to put those red paddle extenders onto the car even though its a manual so I removed them. They also put a large 1LE badge on the dash as well as on the spoiler, just in case the matte black hood wasn't obvious enough or if I forget what I'm driving.

The steering reminds me a lot of the ZL1 1LE and the 1LE suspension, while firm, is compliant enough for street driving. The exhaust makes some pretty loud cracks and pops on deceleration but when just cruising the exhaust is quite tame even in track mode until you get on it.

As usual the interior space is terrible, the wireless phone charger is to small and won't fit my phone and the center console storage is barely large enough to hold my sunglasses.

Thanks to the rearview camera mirror and properly adjusted mirrors the blind spots are gone. I still feel like I'm looking out of a bunker but I don't mind. The recaro seats are quite snug, they actually feel more snug then what comes in the ZL1 1LE I had or maybe I just put on a few pounds since then, probably the latter.

Overall I'm glad to have a manual again and I'm happy its another Camaro, I've always like these cars despite the flaws.

710,1704507447.0,"No, EV’s still don’t make sense for the majority.","I do relatively well I think. I grew up with a family that struggled to make ends meet, and our parents instilled in us a sense of “do or die” when it came to education, caution when making decisions and getting good jobs. 99% of web recipe intros aside, the reason I bring it up is because of the “caution when making decisions bit” in particular and EV’s.

The cheapest EV in Canada right now is $44000 brand new(Nissan Leaf)…perfect for a bunch of leafs. Ahem. Anyway, it’s not bad for what it is, but I think that people who are all in the EV sphere, be it pure interest or policy makers, legislators are absolutely missing the mark of what the masses can swallow. This strange distancing over the past decade or so between those in power or those well off enough and the masses is really bleeding into everything and no matter how much people scream, there’s no brakes being applied at all.

Let me break it down:

\*1)\****EV’s are cheap!:***

*No. Again, the drift between the well off enough/wealthy and the masses is distorting things. $44,000 is a lot compared to what the average Canadian make in a year. After taxes, it's pretty much 40.*

\*2)\****They’re not cheap, but they’re better for the environment. Think about the future!:***

*I hear you. I’m with you. But when you are struggling to feed your children or even yourself, it is very hard to think about the future, positively at least and you are more worried about making it to the next pay date.*

\*3)\****There’s credits and discounts from the state!:***

*In Canada the maximum is $5000. We also pay more for vehicles than the US does. But to make matters even worse, these credits do NOT apply to used vehicles. Only brand new ones. For all the talk about “EV’s so good” by the state and promoters, all the talk about how serious climate change is and yada yada, they do not allow used EV’s to be discounted, they do not allow brands such as BYD into North America, or are trying to make it prohibitively expensive at any rate. So I’m not sure about the circles some of you move in, but in mind, the thought process is “Man, that climate stuff is overblown. If it were so serious, they’d be doing a lot to try and ease the switch”. That’s the cold truth.*

\*4)\****Then just buy a used EV from 2001!:***

*Even people who are EV owners and can live with them comfortably enough financially, still have to deal with potential issues and there are no shortage of stories of batteries going belly up or other teething issues that can be ludicrously expensive. If the masses cannot afford $40000 for an  EV without bleeding, then they sure as hell cannot afford the insane costs associated with EV repair at this point in time. Even those well off enough balk at some of these stories.*

***5) Super fast charging, it's cheaper than gas No more gas stations!:*** 

*Super fast charging is mostly for newer EV's(Again, see pricing) and most people rent in our economy, so there is no readily available charging besides standard power outlets. And many landlords will outright say no to the cost of improving stall power, or even worse, will look at you and say ""If you have money for an EV and want us to put in better power, then you can afford the rent increase we'll give you"". It's good that a lot of manufacturers are moving to NACS in 2024+ and can all use the Tesla network, but the whole ""No more gas stations"" point at least falls apart for the majority, because you'll still have to drive out somewhere to ""fill up"" if you can even afford an EV while renting.*

6*)A lot of the “cheaper” EV’s, even the aforementioned Nissan leaf, often are a bit small for families at the costs they come in at. Most driveways have an SUV or truck, and I don’t see those sales patterns changing, regardless of whether people are always fully utilizing them or not. It’s why the Tesla Model Y is such a volume seller for EV’s, while the model 3 lags behind.*

This all came up because once again I went browsing for EV’s and even searching nationally, I could not find anything sub $50,000 that was not either old(er) and with the potential for ticking time bomb fun, or just too much money for a vehicle at $500-700+ monthly payments, even stretching things out to insane 96 month terms. I mentioned earlier that one of the things my parents instilled in me was the idea of making decisions, particularly financial ones very carefully. The reason for that is because when you’re poor, struggling or even just “doing alright”. Dumping $40,000 on a new car is frightening. Even purchasing a \*used\* EV is a worrisome enough. And why? Because the masses cannot absorb catastrophic financial failure. Even a loss of say $500 in a month because you were ill or injured, whatever; can set the average person back very deeply.

I know, I know, “Bro, EV’s bro”. Yes, and again, I’m with EV’s, I love them as well! But I’m telling you guys, the average person looks at the sticker price and balks. I've been yapping about EV's ever since I test drove a model Y and the people around me all say the same thing, ""Yeah, they seem nice, but too expensive"". Literally two of my coworkers have recently gone out and purchased 2 used vehicles, 2021 models, both SUV's(An escape and somethng else I can't recall off the top of my head) and when I asked why they didn't go EV; they both said ""Nobody has money for that lol"".

And it is the average person that would make the most impact regarding climate, pollution, etc because we \*are\* the masses. Not people running around in $50,000+ vehicles and not even discounting USED, relatively new still EV’s.

**In short: For all the talk about EV’s, there are still major hurdles and some of them such as:**

*1)	No discounts on used EV’s when they still cost a ton*

*2)	Very high base prices*

*3)	Smaller sizes for cheaper EV’s*

*4)	Global tensions/conflicts holding back cheaper EV’s*

726,1704405414.0,Alpine A110S : 6-month ownership review.,"Hello there,

So didn't need to wait 1 year for this review since my previous car was also an Alpine A110, albeit a ""Pure"" (entry-range trim) version.

This previous car gave me a taste of trackdays and so I made the decision to stay within the Alpine brand but with a version better tailored for the occasional fun on track. Reddit review : [https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/vdobo3/18month\_ownership\_review\_alpine\_a110/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/vdobo3/18month_ownership_review_alpine_a110/)  
A change of job made the switch possible, I went for a trade-in on the A110 for peace of mind and the value was alright.

My first car ever was a ND Miata with the 1.5L engine and 6MT, very fun and I kinda miss it sometimes : [https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/dlzlb5/shes\_here\_first\_car\_and\_first\_miata\_just\_waiting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/dlzlb5/shes_here_first_car_and_first_miata_just_waiting/)

The A110 Pure was a great experience, plenty fun on the road (more on that below) and definitely the most bangs for your buck version, paid 61.5K€ for it new with the must-have options, didn't felt like a lot.

# The spec

So with a larger budget this time I went for :

\- Alpine Blue paint : really didn't want this at first, it's the most common so wanted something different when I first specced the car.  
Thunder Gray felt a bit boring for the sporty spec I had in mind, Abyss Blue is too dark and wouldn't let the carbon bits shine, Fire Orange was too much for me. So only had limited Atelier paints left at 5000€, Emerald Green is sweet but felt more at home on a Lotus, and Montebello Gray was already sold out.  
So went for Alpine Blue in the end since it's actually pretty stunning for its price (1800€), sporty without being too show-off, and light enough to let the carbon bits contrast nicely. Would be a nice contrast with the S-trim orange bits too.

\- Carbon aero kit : really gives a much sportier look, although can leave the car looking less ""smooth"" but wanted all the track-day related options as well as an as different spec as possible compared to my previous Alpine, since I was already buying the same car I wanted to differentiate it strongly. 5400€ option (6400€ now).  
Gives more downforce too of course, although you need to be on fast tracks to really feel it I'd say, but at least it'll always reduce lift and therefore participate in the tight chassis experience.

\- Carbon roof : same as the aero kit, shaves off 1.8kg pretty high so good way to lower the CoG, also looks very good imo. 2400€ option (3400€ now).

\- Forged Fuchs wheels in titanium gray paint : lighter wheels available and best-looking to me, another 1.500€ or so.  
Went for red calipers to avoid the standard S orange ones, didn't look that great to me.

\- Extended alcantara interior pack : replace almost all the leather (wheel, bucket seats, central piece, dash, roof lining) with Alcantara, looks more sporty, less glare and very nice to have on the steering wheel imo, 2.000€ or so.

\- Blacked out light up front and translucent lights on the rear : gives a meaner look up front and gives the same look as the R version on the rear, felt like a good choice to avoid the classic red color to get a smoother rear end visually.

\- Focal Premium audio : had the standard Focal in the previous one, sounded very good for a small sportcar sound system so went for the best version this time, adding a sub and a better amp. Definitely gives more oomph to the sound especially at highway speeds, without feeling bloated and unbalanced, one of the truly surprising thing is this little 1130kg two-seater.

\- Orange safety belts to lighten up the interior and merge better with the S trim orange bits. Also harness pre-setup installation. It adds attach points to make it very easy to install harnesses later on, planning on doing this before Spring since I plan on going to Spa for a track-day.

\- And of course 300hp and the S chassis setup, more on that below.

Total OOTD price was around 96k€, so around 50% more than my previous Alpine.

It ends up looking like this : [https://imgur.com/a/kKvDACX](https://imgur.com/a/kKvDACX)

# As a daily

Starting with this because it's actually my only car hehe.

So I already knew how great the Alpine could be as a do-all machine, but the S was supposed to be a bit too stiff for every day traffic and city roads.  
Well one short test-drive was enough to find the S to be perfectly livable enough and 3500km later I don't regret the switch on the daily stuff.

It's indeed a bit rougher at low speeds and on bad pavement, but the low weight (2490 pounds !!) still lets the S breathes nicely with the road, and it's actually even smoother when you're going rapidly as the sharper chassis gives you more confidence.

Storage space is still low but OK for a week or two away if you pack accordingly.

It's way better for long highway drives with the sharper chassis, it doesn't wobble as much as the standard A110 so you don't have to grip the wheel as firmly. You can cruise at 150km/h for hours in relative silence and most importantly in total confidence, whereas the normal A110 is a bit more worrying at high speed turns and gets unsettled even more when it's windy.

The Focal Premium is a nice addition for long drives too, giving clear and powerful balanced sound rendition.The new cars also have CarPlay so a big plus with Waze and Apple Music on the center screen.

Lastly, the aero kit front spoiler is not as troublesome as I feared, the Alpine has a pretty good ground clearance so I can still take speed bumps easily. Only some weird angles in underground parkings or country roads junctions have to be approached with caution, I already bruised the underside of the front lip twice, lightly.

# On the road

So, how fun is it then ?

Well, very ! It's still that magical little sportcar that gives you ton of fun like the A110 Pure, only even better.

Biggest differences are the front end, the body control, steering feel and sound.The chassis is lower and stiffer and you feel it every second. The front end is massive fun, reminds me of the Lotus Elise Cup 250 I tried a few years ago before buying the A110.

Steering was a weakish point on the base car, but here it has both more weight and better feedback, definitely not regretting I didn't went with a Lotus now that I have the S. Still not as great an Elise mind you, but really pretty nice and better than the 718 S I tried on track before ordering the S.

Body control is much tighter, the base car is known for its overdone body roll, giving it magical compliance on the worst roads but making the car a bit unfocused at high speed and on track.  
The S really goes for more of a German sportcar setup but manages to mostly keep that uncanny compliance thanks to the low weight.

Brakes are still awesome, I had the 320mm optional discs on the Pure and they come standard on the S. My favorite brakes in this price segment, as fun to use as the steering wheel of an Elise/Exige, they're very un-assisted and give you tons of feedback, perfect for trail-braking. Just have to remove the little plastic bits in front in order to get a decent-enough cooling for the front brakes. Definitely good enough for trackday beginners, of course if you go to Spa/Nurb once a month and have a great level you'll want better pads and coolant at least.

And the sound is finally good enough for my ears, I have to remind you it's a small 1.8L turbo 4-cylinder engine equipped with all the funny European stuff (particle filters, catalyser etc.) so sounding good wasn't a given.  
But it does sound pretty nice, the 300hp engine setup have a more agressive pop-and-bang soundtrack, and the cabin noises are still very fun with lots of turbo/induction sounds. The engine really screams nicely behind your head when over 3000rpm.

Engine power is also up, giving more kick to the car, both in low end torque and high end peak power, so you can speed up in a stronger manner after some fun corners on country roads or just have more breath to pass at highway speeds.

So in the end, even though it was tailored for track use I find it to be a better choice for me on the open road.

# On the track

Well the differences are even greater on track, after all this particular spec is made for this and it's the best place to enjoy the tighter chassis.

The best difference is how much more confident you are with the S, the chassis is really talking to you in a clearer way at track speeds compared to the base car.  
The front end is epic, massive, solid, planted, agile, you can attack any corner with huge confidence in what's happening up front and what's going to happen throughout the whole turn.The base car you had to really load the front under braking to get something solid but you'd lose the rear in the process. Here with the S the whole car stays composed and the front end is just tons of pure fun.

The additional power is mostly felt on track too (300hp vs 252 for the Pure), it stops losing wind after 5500 rpm like in the base car and you get peak hp up until 6500 rpm here so more fun to explore the top range.

Did my first trackday in October once I reached 3000km and it was lots of fun, no problem with the brakes for now.I have the Michelin PS4 tires so not even the best ones for the track. They were OK but you can feel they overheat a bit so have to keep sessions at 15mn max so they can cool down. Would love to try Cup2's but bad choice for a daily in winter here.

On-board track video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nzR92cQxQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nzR92cQxQI)
Fastest lap is the 5th one. 

# What about the A110R ? And closing thoughts.

The R version launched 6 months before I took delivery of my S (12 months total wait time oof), so naturally I had big questions about it. It's mostly even better than my S (did some laps with a R owner on track) but some critical points are making it a bad choice as an only car, plus it's pretty overpriced for the small performance delta you get versus an aero kit-equipped S.  
I could have changed my order for an R since the car doesn't enter actual production before the final 8 weeks or so but decided not to in the end.

The R has carbon wheels, fixed passenger-side carbon bucket seats, no rear windows (carbon cover instead), and only harnesses (no safety belts possible). No front/rear proximity sensors either, no subwoofer audio option. And it's 30k€ over the S.  
The suspensions are brilliant too, and it does look even sportier (in a good way) to me. But the massive price delta doesn't get justified, press reviews only found a minimal lap time diff with a Cup2 aero kit S.

Still I love the carbon bucket seats, the carbon bonnet, the carbon skirts and rear diffuser, I'll try to snag some R-bits for my S down the road then.

Apart from that I plan on keeping this S for the next 4 years because changing cars every 18 months like I did prior to that has proven to be quite the financial ruin. So I'll baby this one and have fun with it for quite some time, and may invest in some mods once the warranty is gone like titanium exhaust, Ohlins dampers, track-oriented brake mods...

Always loved Lotus too but the Emira isn't what I'm interested in. Next step if I had the buying power would be a 911 GT3 or 718 GT4/RS but pretty sure they're not as fun on the open road though, still planning on renting both the 992 GT3 and 718 GT4RS on track in the coming months just to see what's up.   
But yeah a two-seater as light and fun and polyvalent as my current S will indeed be hard to replace in the future I fear, we'll see !

Hope you enjoyed the read (long one tho I'm sorry), don't hesitate if you have questions or anything. I always take the time of writing review for these Alpines since they're not available in the US so I guess some of you are curious.

The Ferrari 430 Scuderia comes to mind, the paddles had long throws, perfect resistance, and when you change gear you can hear the action of the shifting solenoids - all in all just a really cool, mechanical experience.

With manuals becoming more and more rare,  I think the feel of paddles will become more important to enthusiasts.",cars

I know that you need to build an engine once you reach the limits of stock internals but I'm wondering are they more reliable in the long term, since they used forged instead of cast parts? I'm talking about if you build a motor and keep it at stock levels or the same levels as FBO, will it last longer than the stock engine? Obviously they won't last forever if you beat on it constantly with crazy power but I'm wondering if they are as good or better than stock engines when pushing factory or FBO power.

755,1704238940.0,"I think that manufacturers naming their EV's the same as their existing gas cars is a big mistake, especially when the gas version is still being sold alongside it","Like look at the Blazer and the Blazer EV.  Blazer starts at $35,400 while Blazer EV starts at $56,715 according to Chevy's website.  Now, realistically most Blazers are likely leaving the lot in the mid-40's range and the Blazer EV will probably have some kind of limited-time incentive, but we can also assume most Blazer EV's on lots will be more like mid-60 to 70 range.

The Blazer EV is a little bigger, roomier, has more features, obviously it's an EV, it's like the cutting edge of GM's lineup.  But when it comes down to it, I think most people are going to look at the price as the end-all-be-all, and seeing a $20,000 upcharge on the EV version I think will make the Blazer EV a harder sell for Blazer buyers, because even if they have the money for the EV version, they'll still associate it with the normal Blazer and, at least subconsciously I think, associate it with being way more expensive than they expect to pay for that name.

I almost have to wonder if that makes it a harder sell for upmarket buyers as well, because they will associate the Blazer name with a cheaper vehicle, and would likely rather gravitate towards an existing luxury model or brand in that $70,000 price range.

I was going to say Cadillac is doing things right with the Lyriq having no existing comparison, but then I just went on their website and saw the Escalade EV, which also has its own whopping $50,000 upcharge over a standard Escalade.",cars

770,1704065830.0,What's Mazda's Next Move?,"Mazda being a small manufacturer is so interesting to me. With their unique history and courage to be different, I wanted to talk about what everyone thinks might be their future especially regarding electrification.

I know they just released the CX-90 with their new PHEV powertrain, and interestingly it's gotten mixed results. I heard the transmission could be tuned better and Mazda still needs to be a better job in terms of interior space and practicality. Electrification concerns aside, if they developed/released a hybrid for their models and focused on practicality with their design language I do think they would pose a threat to Honda. If the Mazda 6 rumors are dead though, I'm not sure what else they could feasibly put the i6 PHEV powertrain into.

Like most others here, I really hope they sell enough SUVs/CUVs to justify developing a Mazda 6 luxury sports sedan. My dream would be the same PHEV powertrain with a liftback similar to Audi. A new, reliable, and MODERN Japanese sports sedan sounds refreshing, but given that even bigger players like Lexus haven't put money into the segment and the TLX selling poorly and then the G70 being discontinued, it's not likely at all. I honestly wouldn't even mind if it were co-developed with Lexus or something.

I'm actually a fan of EVs, but I can't see Mazda having enough resources to pull it off an EV until Toyota or bigger manufactures had a few years or more head start. I'm honestly not sure where Mazda is going with that. I believe there were rumors about a hybrid/EV Miata, but I hope they're putting it into a nice selling SUV/CUV first. I think going Toyota's route with hybrids would be a good idea as well. Just wanted to know anyone else's thoughts!",cars

778,1703967289.0,How many of y'all remember when Detroit offered luxury editions of its sporty and economy models?,"There was the Camaro Type LT / Berlinetta, the Pontiac Firebird Esprit, the Mustang Grande / Ghia, the Dodge Challenger SE, and the Plymouth Barracuda Gran Coupe. These cars usually came with stuff like leather or plush velour upholstery, power everything, lighted visor vanity mirrors, extra map / reading lights, lots of fake wood trim, stuff like that. For whatever reason, most buyers of those versions didn't usually opt for the high performance engines or heavy duty suspensions to go with their luxury. 

There was even the Mercury Bobcat, which was a heavily tarted-up Ford Pinto. As a kid growing up in the 70's, I even saw Ford Pintos with vinyl roofs and hubcaps specially painted to match the car. Finally, there was the car that made GM a laughing stock- the infamous ""Cadillac"" Cimarron.

Don't get me wrong, they are fantastic pieces of engineering marvels. I had a Diablo SV and a Viper on my walls as a kid. I love supercars, but I'm curious if it's an age thing or if we're going through a shift (lol) to where since they are relatively common, we're a bit disensitized.

As the exotic designs and materials become easier to produce and manufacture, I stopped getting that jaw-dropping feeling of ""holy f. That's a Ferrari!!!""

Is it because I'm not a kid anymore and used to be excited about supercars more, or is it because of a loss of ""individuality"" due to supercars being more common? I want to see the ""hidden gems"" now instead.

I somehow ended up spending 25 mins geeking out over an Autozam and then another 20 talking to a high school kid about his clean, 50k original mile '72 Continental he got from his grandma and was sorting it all out by himself since it's been sitting. Poor kid must have felt like an altar boy with the amount of old dudes all around him.

TL;DR: did I think supercars were cooler 15 years ago because I was a kid, or do I think they aren't as cool now because of how much easier it is to produce them and we're desensitized?

Back in the 1800's, cars didn't exist at all so the term ""car"" didn't either. But when gasoline vehicles were made, the term ""car"" was made to follow it. Then after cars like the Countach and Testarossa which were a lot faster than a lot of other cars, we made the term ""supercar"". Then after top speed demons like the Veyron, Agera(s), and Chiron, we made the term ""hypercar"" to show it is once again faster than cars before. 

I personally doubt we will go above hypercar since getting to 300mph was already hard enough and getting to 400, hell, even 350mph is borderline impossible.

As I entered College the S4 was introduced and that replaced my M3 dreams for awhile. Something about the B5 really spoke to me, and I loved Audi’s Group B background and the BTCC Audi A4 race car.
