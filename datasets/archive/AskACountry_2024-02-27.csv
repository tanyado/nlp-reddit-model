1,1703348757.0,Do most westerners look down upon India?,"Hello all,

I am an Indian living in a western country for the past 8 years. I asked a friend (Caucasian) recently if he wanted to visit India. He told me he doesn’t want to because his wife (her ethnicity is south Asian but she was born and brought up in Canada) told him that India is dirty and people are close minded and that she hates it. This kind of hit me hard. I did not respond to him because I didn’t know what to say. I have heard similar remarks from my colleagues recently. Talking about outsourcing work to Indian agencies and how Indian people are cheap. 

I love my country. Seeing people categorizing India as dirty makes me feel uncomfortable to say the least. Does everyone feel the same way about India? I know it is true to some extent, but is it really that bad from a westerner’s perspective? I love the culture, the people and the food. The rich heritage and history India has is unmatched. 

Having lived in multiple countries, I feel that ultimately, countries like USA, Canada are not that different from India. I would say the differences are on the surface level. But deep down, western countries also face similar issues like India. The scale and flavor might be different. US has drug problems, gun culture, racism, corruption to some extent and more. Being a brown woman working in corporate, I have noticed discrimination against women and people of color. India has issues with population, corruption, economic disparity, low living standards etc.

My friends remarks made me really upset. He mentioned multiple times that his wife hates the country. 

Do you also feel the same way about India?

45,1605045404.0,Non-Brazilians: Have your overall perception over Brazil/Brazilians changed in these last couple of years?,"Hello,

I have been wondering lately how Brazil is currently being perceived by nationals of other countries. I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this, but here I go.

I know for a fact that it is hard to have a good grasp on how people from different cultural groups are and behave, and even harder to keep track of what is currently happening in other countries. We usually resort to stereotypes, and I think this is not a problem, provided that we keep in mind that it is a generalization that might not be accurate and/or applicable to everyone from the targeted group.

&#x200B;

I often ask people what they think about Brazil in order to understand what is the Brazilian stereotype, and the answers are usually the same: Brazil is the country of (most of) the Amazon forest, football, carnival and sunny beaches. Brazilian nationals tend to be friendly and warm, welcoming, and usually optimists. In sum, I could quote John Oliver on Brazilians by saying ""what a fun bunch!"".

Of course, there are negative impressions. I think the most notorious one must be the extreme violence in some Brazilian regions (and unfortunately it is mostly true). I am sure there are negative remarks on the character of Brazilian stereotypes as well (people usually do not tell me out of politeness, although I wouldn't get offended).

&#x200B;

Since Brazil was not usually in the spotlight of global media coverage before, I used to consider that the above description depicts the global general impression of Brazil and its people. But in the last couple of years, things... Changed a lot around here. Highlights include: huge Amazon fires, being one of the biggest COVID epicenter in the world (it still is, don't be misled by our numbers since we are not testing enough people), and the constant controversial remarks made by the current Brazilian president Bolsonaro, which is frequently dubbed as ""the tropical Trump"".

I imagine at least some of these things are being covered by your local news. I have also seen from foreign media that although Brazil used to be a great reference in the fields of diplomacy, health and environmental policies until a couple of years ago, it is quickly becoming an international pariah in all of these fields. So I imagine this may have at least a bit of repercussion into the current general impression of Brazil.

&#x200B;

So this is my question to you: what do you think of Brazil right now? Has your perception changed from what it used to be some years ago? I would love to hear your honest opinion on this matter, and will not get offended towards negative impressions.

What I've seen for people that are calling the coronavirus a hoax, not listening to medical experts, protesting the stay at home orders, etc, have been from far right conservatives who are enamored with Trump because the people Trump perceives as a threat are the same people they do.  Largely, they are people from more rural areas, have a romanticized view of how the united states used to be, view change as a threat, and believe in a ""strict"" interpretation of the constitution.  Their complaints about the lockdown have been that the they are taking away from their (misinterpreted) freedoms guaranteed by the constitution, particularly right to public assembly, freedom of religion, and right to bare arms.",AskACountry

I do wildlife habitat restoration work, I've worked for a Soil And Water Conservation District (not quite local, not quite state), the USDA (US Dept of Agriculture) in the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) and Department of Forestry. 

My career objective is to work at a federal/provincial or local level to provide project management, grant administration and expertise in how to recreate, enhance, protect and conserve wildlife habitat, and administer programs or enforcement of regulations that do the same. 

Often people get confused and think of me as forester or a fish biologist, when really the jobs I've had and my education are more broad and shallow than the type of specific narrow but deep expertise specifically in one kind of tree or type of animal and that make's it very difficult to know what kind of agencies provide the services I am trained to do within a completely different government structure. 

My background is a Bachelors of Science in Economics and Environmental Science, as well as a Masters in Natural Resource Management and if anyone out there in Canada has or is doing similar habitat work, I'd really love to have a conversation to orient myself to what agencies I would offer me similar opportunities.

I do quite a bit of notarizing at this job, and nine out of ten notaries is an Indian-related Notary. The first part of the notarization process is you showing me your drivers license, because the entire point of a notary is to legally prove that you are who you say you are when signing a document. A lot of times it’s a family that comes in, and when I ask for the licenses of anyone who is signing (usually a husband and wife, along with their kids) the husband will pull his licens out of his wallet, and then he will pull out his wife’s license from right behind it. Why is this? My feeling is that it has something to do with control. Because, as I understand it (was told by an Indian friend), in India, the husband has all the power and likes to be in control at all times of anything the wife does. If I’m wrong on that, please correct me. But as I said, my theory is that the husband holds both licenses because it’s a power thing. I’d really like to have some feedback on this. Please fill me in!

I ask for help to know the current situation of the City of Debrecen. Me and my wife are applying for the scholarship program offered by the Hungarian government, the Stipendium Hungaricum Scholarship Program, to study for a Masters in Engineering, both of us.

We focus on the courses of the city of Debrecen. I understand that we must first go through the scholarship(win it) to start thinking about certain subjects, but we would like to know some other details about the city, the country, the economic situation and the labor market for our area, as we have great interest in emigrating to there , we'll both try the scholarship.

About us, we are married, I am 26 years old, a Mechanical Engineer graduated, 3 years of work experience, the most relevant work was as Project Manager/Analyst at the Olympic Games in Rio2016, fluent in English and several courses and other experiences. My wife is a Civil Engineer, also with fluent English, experience of trainee in multinational, outside other experiences in the curriculum.

We live in Brazil, in Rio de Janeiro, and we have total interest in moving, at least having lived an international experience. Coupled with what, we have researched about Hungary, we are taking more and more interest in moving there, because of the qualitu of life and other aspects.

The various questions about the city and the work environment, I try to list all that I think is important, but I gladly accept all the help on any other subject, liek: housing, public utilities, communities for information exchange (Facebook / reddit / etc), receptiveness of the city, imagration aspects on Debrecen. We consider ouselves a conservative couple, and, after all the recearch, Debrecen looks live a great city to rase a family.

- In an underemployment (Waiter, assistant, auxiliary), is it possible to live comfortably? (Please, do not misunderstand, is that in Brazil, specifically in Rio de Janeiro, living well with the salary of these jobs is almost impossible)

- Which companies consider immigrants?(I don't know if there is xenophobia in the city) Which companies prefer new post-graduates?

- What are the nearby cities with companies in our area of ​​activity(Engeineering)?

- With English, in Debrecen, is it possible to find employment in this region? During the first period of the course we do not intend to work, but from the second. (You all may suggest 'distant' places, we do not mind having to travel to another city every day to work.)

- Which are the best companies for our engineering?

- Is it necessary to learn Hungarian to get a job in our area or learning as the time goes is possible?

- How long to learn a fluent level to apply for jobs in the engineering sector?

""From your experiences, it is ""manageable"" to work and study?"" I imagine the study to be very much more profund compared to the graduation, which will take up my whole day, I suppose.

- Given our second intention, to emigrate. Is it permissible / valid, if you can get a good job, leave the master's degree to work and apply for the residence permit? Comment about please.

These are some of the questions I have, but I appreciate any and all help on issues that have not been covered here

I was wondering about this today as I went down a Wikipedia hole on different alphabets and writing systems. I know the Latin alphabet and the Cyrillic alphabet; having learned the Cyrillic alphabet, I would (roughly, informally) say it 'seems' angular, sharp, and occasionally 'backwards'.

So, I normally won't go to the doctor when I've got coughing/sore throat. I know it's a cold virus and I know there's nothing the doctor can give me to treat my symptoms that's more effective than what I can get at the pharmacy by myself. The visit only cost me 15 dollars, but I know it's really more like $200 to my insurance company, and somebody has to pay for that one way or another. After all, the doctor is just going to tell me to get plenty of rest and water.

This is in the USA, but my attitude towards it may be unusual, and I know in some places like Japan, it's seems to be normal to go to the doctor for a cold, even if they give the same recommendations and medicine as doctors in the US would, and it doesn't appear to be any more ""useful"".

For starters, I'm 19, introvert, female, white, American. I only speak English and would want to move with my family. 

Yes:
A safe place with Little to no natural disasters and a low murder rate. Good internet. Online shipping costs aren't high. Artist and Writing communities. 

I need *privacy* and nature. Being able to have my own world, but without being too far away from things and being able to access them. I would love to be able to distribute my artwork in big companies, so I'd have to be at least somewhat near a city.

Not necessary but nice:
Reduced Youth Culture. The American culture of ""never growing up"" and the pressure to be interesting all of the time and the intolerance of silence annoys me. 

Woods, but want little to no ticks. I also like mountains and rolling hills (for views and hiking), though those aren't a must. Being able to go to restaurants and being able to just sit there for however long without it being appeared as hogging seats is nice. I also love discount and thrift stores (good will) and old-fashioned book stores.  I LOVE seafood like crabs, salmon, sushi, and fresh fruit like apples, grapes, cantaloupe. Fruit doesn't have to be year round. 

I want seasons to some degree, but not too drastic. I don't really need snow but like when it powders the land. I live in CT where there's a lot of snow, though, so I don't mind.

I have considered Panama, specifically Bouquete, but the crime rate is getting worse (to my knowledge) and the prices have gone up. Plus the abilities to promote my artwork and novels would be very low, since it's a retirement area. If I moved in another area, their culture beliefs would crash with mine.

I've considered New Zealand, but a few things concern me:

A: Can't get in. For some reason, my parents have to be 60+ to get in and we don't have the amount of money required.

B: Unbelievably Expensive.

C: Little to no house insulation and bad internet.

D: Earthquakes and volcanic areas. That scares me.

Because the justice and honor is a myth here. Everyone has heard about these words, but honestly who goes in real life ?
I threw Institute , though my grades were above all in the group . I was so naïve that thinking that in instetute I learn useful things . But in fact it turned out that many teachers are absolutely not competent . Especially this applies to IT . Many do not want to teach and demand bribes for examination. And there are those who just like to be rude to students , knowing that they will remain unpunished . There are good teachers , but they are few . I remember only 2 or 3 . Most of the students are also happy to pay a bribe to teach nothing .

In the third year I stayed one who did not want to pay bribes. And I'm so tired of it of incompetence and rudeness and threats that I will not get the exam because I was different. 
The reality in Russia is such that you do not get a normal job if you do not have a diploma of graduation . And nobody cares that you are a good programmer, especially if you are a woman .
This is just one example of why I do not have any good feelings for this country and the people who live here.
And it's not talking about a huge corruption.
I often think that people here hate each other , and are not capable of compassion, or honor , or the right choice .

The only reason I'm still alive , it's because I have a little hope to leave the country and try to forget everything that happened here . Not today, but someday .

So, today I spoke with one person that I want to leave this country forever , and she said that in all countries the same.

As a Czech I can say that we view Slovaks as our brothers and closest friend, due to being one country for so long. I think they're considered hard working, ambitious and friendly. 

I grew up close to the Polish borders so I kinda like Poland, but I think that general opinion on Poles in the Czech Republic is not that high. Which is strange because I've heard that Poles really like Czech people. I'll say that Czechs thinks of Poles as brave and proud nation, but at the same time stubborn and untrustworthy. 

Czechs had some hard times with both Germans and Austria, but I think we've finally got over it and we pretty much like them. I mean, there are German movies and shows on TV (Semir Gerkhan, fuck yeah!), a lot of our companies is owned by Germans and both Germany and the Czech Republic are the beer countries! We surely do not like the language though and Germany is not really that much of a tourist destination for us, but we have no problem with Germans. And we have even better opinion on Austrians since Vienna is a must-see place for us. And am I the only one or do Austrian German sounds a lot like German with accent or at least something French?

Does the show portray a ""typical"" Danish school?

In Denmark, what are the laws regarding student-teacher physical contact?

Does the show portray a socioeconomically typical school, or is it more of an upper-class school for more privileged families?

First off, I'm not looking for advice on the interview part, unless there is something I need to know about the Dutch interview process that differs from the American process.  

What I'm looking for is primarily a primer on what kinds of things to expect and/or ask for from the company.  I don't want to jinx it so I'm not going to go into too many details, but this is a large international firm for whom I'd be doing IT (server and networking) work.  Some background on us: we're all US citizens, I'm 32, she's 38, kids are 3 and 5.  I work, she's a homemaker, kids are unemployed layabouts, soon to start school.  Here are some general questions: 

1. Where can I find accurate salary comparisons?  I have googled, but I always have the feeling that I'm getting the best advertised sites, not necessarily the *best* sites.  Do you know of a good site for comparing salaries, especially in the Windows Server Admin arena?
1. What can I expect as cost of living for a family of 4 (myself, the wife, and our two girls aged 3 and 5)?  This is especially important as we'd likely be a single-income family for a while.  Ideally, we'd have a three bedroom apartment/flat, in a nice neighborhood, that came furnished/finished.  We aren't extravagant, we go out to dinner once or twice a week (sometimes less, sometimes more), but we prefer to cook at home, no (real) dietary restrictions, though we try to eat gluten-free (not because of the gluten, but because eating that way forces us to eat healthier in general).  
1. Follow on to previous: What can I expect in terms of childcare and school? 
1. I understand health insurance is mandatory, and costs roughly €100/person/month.  Is that accurate? 
1. What kinds of things should we look at bringing with us, rather than buying there?  Obviously, no TV, nor major appliances like a dishwasher, but is there anything we *should* look at? 
1. Is it common for companies there to offer relocation services?  How much is that worth and how does it work?  Should I ask for it?
1. Should I be offered (or ask for) transportation and/or housing allowances?  What is the norm for these things? 
1. Do Dutch employers offer assistance for childcare or schooling?  
1. I've heard of the 30% rule, but I haven't had a chance to look it up yet, any good resources for info on that? 
1. Do Dutch companies do employment contracts, and what are typical terms?  For example, while I was in the UAE, I was contractually obligated to work for the company on a yearly basis, with renewals up for option at the 11th month.  I was legally required to work for that company for the term of my contract, or face expulsion/deportation, or go contractless (which is a bit scary there) at the end of my contract; it made switching jobs virtually impossible.  Is it similar in NL? 
1. What else should I be thinking about that I haven't thought of yet?

I have also noticed that, even in areas that have very high and low temperatures, insulation is almost non-existent with even newer home walls being made up of two layers of plywood with nothing in between.

Now, as per the title, why? Surely it must be obvious to anyone that, when large amounts of money are spent on heating or cooling your home it is very financially sound to invest in proper home insulation.

602,1415416246.0,[USA] I have some questions about growing up with imperial units.,"I grew up with metric units. I can understand how a kilometer converts to meters, and I know when it makes sense to use one scale or another. But I'm currently travelling the States and get confused when you would use miles, yards and feet.

The clearest example must be traffic signs. I've seen some with fractions of miles (1/2, 1/4), which I think make sense on roads. But I've also seen some others in feet, like ""Parking 2000 feet"". That's actually more than a quarter of a mile, so why not use ""0.4 miles""? Or feet for fractions of miles? I also noticed that there aren't any yards on signs. Is there a reason for this? Personally, I could imagine something like 250 yards better than 750 feet, But that may be my metric influence in that 1 yard ~= 1 meter and 1 foot ~= absolutely nothing.

So... In case it weren't enough questions still, here some more: do you make inches-feet-yards-miles conversions a lot? Which information do you use in all four of them?

610,1415044241.0,United States: When is the welfare system considered 'broken?',"

I have a beef.

No actually I don't. I don't have that much beef.

Between my soon to be spouse and I, who are raising two kids, we make make a little over $35/hr combined gross. We're in low to mid-level positions without degrees and working our way up while also paying off student loans that we didn't finish college with. (Life. It happens.)

I look across the street at our neighbors who make minimum wage. They live rent free in their mother's house. They have a brand new truck and a brand new minivan for their four kids.

Their grill is on every night. I see steaks coming off of that grill. Every night.

I know they are getting food share, which gives them the purchasing equivalent (between the two of them) of about $26/hr between the two of them.

We are not getting any level of federal aid aside from state health care benefits for the kids, which sucks so bad that we wind up paying out of pocket for doctor/dentist visits *anyway* half of the time.

I drive a car that is getting close to 20 years old with nearly 200,000 miles on it. The spouse to be has the 'new' car which is 8 years old itself, and we owe more on it than its worth.

Now, at one point we were both without jobs (a couple years back) and we had the foodshare benefits. We worked our way out of it and dropped it. A matter of pride, really. 

But then I look at our neighbors.

I personally make more money than both of those two parents **combined** but cannot afford luxuries like nightly steak. 

I really, really wish that there was some sort of limitation to the foodshare system in the very least, like marked food (what is allowed and what is not). Ribeye is a luxury. NOT a necessity. When I provide my family with good cuts of steak, it is because it is a special occasion--not a nightly fixture.

When we were on food share, we never bought steak. We bought basic food supplies. Rice, bread, vegetables, fruit. We would occasionally splurge and get the kids some cookies. 

Granted, this is really none of my damned business to question what they do, but it is a slap in the face that my taxes are paying for someone else who is already living off of the system and living off of others to eat better than what we as a family can do.

I mean sure, we could have the food share ourselves if my fiance made $0.21 less an hour, giving us $600 a month in free food and freeing that money to go towards a brand new car, but that's just a side note.

WHY in the FUCK am I paying for someone else to have a higher quality of life than my HIGHER PAY can provide?

I feel that Canada's a good option for me, considering the ethnic diversity of the country and the non-existent language barrier (I speak fluent English, but not so fluent Tagalog, due to coming into the UK at a young age). Right now, I feel that I don't understand very well some of the requirements for citizenship, and that costs of living may be too high, especially for transportation to the country alone.

Sweden, I've decided, because they fare well in quality of living and economic development (versus southern Europe, for instance), and have a language easy to learn for English speakers, and due to other factors versus other European countries that favour me moving there.

The geographic distance somewhat plays a part in deciding which country I want to move in, which has at some times led me to favour moving to Sweden. I've heard, however, that racism is quite an issue in Europe, where immigrants are paid less, especially if they are from lesser economically developed countries or are refugees, and are less likely to be offered jobs based on name alone. I've heard [how a Londoner was in for a shock when he was meeting up with his employer] (http://www.thelocal.se/discuss/index.php?showtopic=51498) because he wasn't an ethnic Briton.

I get asked about Detroit a lot when I'm traveling. It has kind of made a name for itself. In the last couple of years we have gone through the largest municipal bankruptcies in America. A city that was built and once inhabited by two million people now boosts a population of just over 600,000 people. You may have heard that the UN was recently here and determined that the City shutting delinquent water off was a humanitarian crisis. More than 1/3 of the city is abandonded and you can buy a house here for about 500.00 in the right (wrong) neighborhood. It is the most segregated city in America.

Now I'm not your usual Detroit. In addition to being born here and living here I also do a lot of charity work surrounding helping homeless/poor youth graduate high school (about 75% don't). But I also work at the much beleaguered but still large and impressive Detroit Institute of Arts (the sixth largest and third most expensive art collections in America) which we had to fight to keep during the bankruptcy.

I read a post the other day about guys using tanning beds, and most guys on that forum (Americans) considered it gay or girl-like for guys to be using them. Whereas here it completely normal and socially accepted.

Then they begin high school, years 7-12 - which they must complete with a Higher School Certificate unless they can 'prove' they have a job or trade to go onto instead. If they do leave early they receive a ROSA. There is no option to 'drop out' at 16yo any more.

The government offers a tax-deductable loan with virtually no interest, that automatically gets taken out of your pay once you're earning over a certain amount (i.e. once you finish your degree and get a job working in the field you're qualified in). 

If I have the test scores from high school, I could gain entry to the best universities Australia has to offer, and complete my degree without any financial burden (aside from living expenses etc). And if the test scores I got in highschool weren't sufficient (eg if I messed around in highschool and got crappy scores), I could do a bridging course free of charge, which is basically repeating year 12. This bridging course would get me into any course I wanted to do except for medicine or law- so any engineering, business, science, arts etc. 

Ok enough bragging about Australia's awesome education. 

So I was reading an article about Harvard, and it made a point to say it was a very expensive, exclusive school that not many people can attend. And it got me to thinking..

I see in (American) movies and TV all the time, a parent who's stressed over paying for their kids college tuition, or like a young girl who strips to pay for her education, that sort of thing. But I really don't know what the deal is.

Elected politicians govern. Responsibilities include: schools, daycare, elderly care, streets, social welfare, garbage, water, sewage, but not electricity, and lots other local stuff.

2) County (landsting - there are 20 of those in sweden, a national population of 9 million makes an average of about 450,000 ppl per ""county"").

Elected politicians govern. Major responsibilities are health care and public transport. And really not that much else.

3) National level:

Elected parliament (Riksdag - 349 members). Prime minister ""elected"" by parliament (which is definition of parliamentarism). King with no power except saying stupid things in media. Oh, and cutting ribbons. Responsibilities: well, everything else. Some examples: police, prisons, higher education (colleges, universities), prosecutors, highways and other big roads and lots more.

4) Above national: let's not forget the EU make a lot of decisions for us as well. The EU can make laws in some areas that will have direct effect in sweden. I'm fairly certain a EU law can not have punishments, like prison time and such.

Here are some possible questions (but feel free, of course, to answer only a subset of them, or add some of your own):

* How would I find a doctor in the first place (yellow pages, specialized directory...)?  Do they typically work in hospitals, an office (alone or with a few colleagues?), some other kind of place?  Would I see a general practitioner first or would it be common to see a specialist immediately?

* How do I make an appointment?  How long in advance do I have to make it?  (Assume it's not an emergency but I still want to see the doctor ASAP.)  How long between the time I enter the doctor's office (or hospital, or whatever) and the time I actually see them?  How long would I see the doctor (face to face)?  What other staff would I see before or after seeing the doctor (nurses, secretaries)?  Is it sometimes possible to see a doctor without a prior appointment?

* How much should I expect to pay, assuming I have no health insurance (if that's even possible in your country: perhaps I'm a tourist with no coverage whatsoever) for a routine visit, with no complications?  And if you do have health coverage, how does it work?  (Does the insurance pay the doctor directly or do you get reimbursed?)

* Do you have some kind of restriction on which doctor you can see?  (Perhaps depending on your health plan.)

* If I'm feeling really unwell (but not to the point that I'm in danger of imminent death), can I get a doctor to see me at home?  And what about a real emergency (e.g., heart attack): what should I do in your country?

What we couldn't figure out is what on Earth do people in Budapest/Hungary use these for regularly enough that it has enough cultural significance to merit a sign on the metro?

These credit bureaus have secret algorithms for consolidating the file they have on you about what credit accounts you have (your ""credit report"") into a score (your ""credit score"") that enables a company to instantaneously approve or deny a request you make to get their credit card or open a credit account.

Boston also works for people who like to walk and be outside (as opposed to driving, which is difficult and best done when going away from the city) and Boston is a great place for variety in weather, from tons of snow in winter to blazing humid summer days and the fall colors coming out now.

Boston has a thriving LGBT culture. A very good place for the exploration of identity and ideas. However, some of the laws and cultural norms around sexual expression going beyond dress and discussion can be constricting, especially in comparison with how liberal the culture presents itself.

On the spectrum between focused and freewheeling, Boston skews much more toward the ""focused"" end of things. But the focus is often toward certain things instead of others.

I have a feeling that Americans will say Philadelphia and Brits would say either Edinburgh or Oxford. Would I be correct?",AskACountry
