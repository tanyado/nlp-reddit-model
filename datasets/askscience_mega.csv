Ask us anything!,"After three years and 72 flights over the surface of Mars, [NASA's Ingenuity helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/) has touched down for the last time. Imagery downlinked from the helicopter indicated that one or more of its rotor blades [sustained damage during its Flight 72 landing on Jan. 18, 2024](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/9540/after-three-years-on-mars-nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-ends/), rendering it no longer capable of flight.

Designed as a technology demonstration that was expected to fly no more than five times over 30 days, the helicopter's primary mission was to prove that powered, controlled flight on another planet was possible, which it did on April 19, 2021. But Ingenuity exceeded expectations, [transitioning into an operations demonstration](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-to-begin-new-demonstration-phase) that paved the way for future aerial exploration on the Red Planet and beyond.

So, have you ever wanted to know what it's like to fly a helicopter on another planet? Or what it's like to [talk to the helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/385/keeping-our-sense-of-direction-dealing-with-a-dead-sensor/) from here on Earth?

2,2,1708991974.0,How is the Milky Way on a collision course with Andromeda?,"So after the Big Bang, everything was sent shooting off at a zillion miles per hour in all different directions. Since everything was going in an outward trajectory from the point of the Big Bang (if space is even considered to have existed then), and assuming there's no/negligible drag on a galaxy zooming through space, how would the velocities of Milky Way and Andromeda change to now be directed towards the point of collision? The only thing I can think of is if they're pulling on each other via gravity, but that seems unlikely given their distance of 2.537 million lightyears.

It is generally considered the “standard” for all outgassing testing criteria, at least in my field. 

What I am struggling to understand is why the TML (total mass loss) is adjusted down based on the WVR (water vapor recovered)? 

The process states that the test sample will be exposed to a 50% RH environment for 24 hours then put into the test environment, which is some X hours at some T temperature (can’t remember exactly what these values are). 

The mass lost in the test environment relative to the mass after the 24hr exposure to 50% RH is the TML. 

Afterwards, there is an “optional” step where the sample is re-exposed to the same 50% RH environment for 24hrs and its mass is measured again. The mass regained can then be deducted from the previously calculated TML to get the adjusted value. 

Why is this allowed? Does outgassing in space not care about water vapor? If so, why not? ",askscience

Then I thought about how woodpeckers protect themselves with their tongue as padding.

The WHO has also acknowledged that additional support will be needed for manufacturers who currently only make quadrivalent vaccines to pivot to making trivalent vaccines.

(I couldn't find anything related to the kidney's salt-filtration power after several minutes of googling.)

By my flawed logic, humans should be able to drink some small amount of sea water, excrete the excess salt using a fraction of the sea water consumed, and then keep the remaining desalinated sea water for hydration.

Using hard numbers: Consume 25ml of sea water containing \~875mg salt, urinate \~3ml of water containing all \~875mg of salt, keep \~22ml water for hydration.

Even if salt can't be excreted at the density at which it can be dissolved, there's still room for more water to be used for urination that's also less than the amount consumed.

Is it feasible to analyze the aged whiskey and then synthetically mature a young whisky by adding in the identified congeners?,"Its my understanding (please correct me if Im wrong) that the difference between diluted ethanol and an alcoholic drink (say whisky) is the presence of congeners - a complex mix of dissolved compounds that develop during production and maturation. Break-down of fermentation/distillation products and the acquisition of solutes present in the oak casks, result in a highly complex mixture of compounds. These compounds, collectively referred to as congeners are what determine the taste/smell of the whisky. The abundance/concentration of various individual congeners is what separates Lagavulin from Laphroaig and more broadly, what separates different kinds of whisk(e)ys.

Lets say you have a well equipped anal chem lab and unlimited time/money. You acquire a bottle of Lagavulin just before its casked, analyze it and then 16y later obtain a bottle from the same cask for comparison. Are modern spectrometry and other analytical techniques advanced enough to confidently identify the precise composition/identity of congeners present in each bottle?

If so, is it possible to isolate (or alternatively, synthesize) the individual congeners in the mature bottle and then add them to the pre-cask whisky (at the measured concentrations) to ""instantly"" mature it? Or is the chemistry during maturation too complex to define and/or reproduce accurately?

Or better yet, as a pipe dream develop a lyophilized ""congener concentrate""  (ideally one free of histamine and other biogenic amines) that one could reconstitute with ethanol+water.

Obviously the cost effectiveness in either case would be questionable. But if you had best proc dev team on earth and could consistently isolate/reconstitute the congeners at large scales, I'd wager it could reap huge profits over the long term.",askscience

In the book, the main character meets an alien, named Rocky, who lives on a planet with such a thick atmosphere that light can't reach the ground. The characters talk with each other about their biology at length in order to learn about one another, and they talk a lot about sleep, too. Rocky has a weird sleep cycle and lives on a planet that also spins very fast. His sleep cycle does not seem to match his planet's day-night cycle. 

This got me wondering about Earth life. From what I understand, all animals sleep, it's almost a biological mandate. Even though some are nocturnal, it seems that sleep cycles are still, somewhat, in tune with the rotation of the Earth. Sunlight would be the main indicator for the body for any creature that can see daylight. 

But what about animals that live in total darkness, like in caves or deep in the ocean? Do we know anything about their sleep patterns? If we do, do they somehow follow a day/night cycle?

I’ve searched far and wide and cannot seem to find any answers. They don’t appear to be the sand ridges of the Simpson desert, they look drastically different, some look like the first picture looks (I see many of these when flying overhead) like off-road tracks/manmade clearing - however they certainly are not as they almost never link to a road, yet are clearly gaps in foliage
Are these survey lines? Mine suitability testing? Maybe even the remains of roads of a ghost town/telegraph line towns?

175,175,1705697156.0,Why does singing while playing a flute creates a subharmonic?,"If you play a note of a certain frequency on a flute and simultaneously sing a note at a different frequency, then you create a third frequency that wouldn't be there if you play or sing in isolation - and the frequency of this subharmonic is the difference of the flute frequency and the voice frequency (I'm talking about the fundamental frequencies for simplicity). This is caused by modulation (product rule: cos(f1*x)cos(f2x) = 0.5*(cos(f1-f2)+cos(f1+f2)), which in turn suggests some nonlinearity in the system.

I made some observations about this effect:

1. It is not unique to flutes- works on any wind instrument (commonly known as Growling on saxophones)
2. It is NOT the Tartini tone / missing fundamental / difference tone. I know it might be tempting to classify it as such, but keep in mind that the Tartini tone is just in your head (caused by some nonlinearity in the hearing apparatus). The subharmonic mentioned here is clearly measurable on a spectrogram.
3. Whistling into the flute does not work. Sure, it produces a beat frequency (linear superposition) and a Tartini tone (illusion in your head), but the subharmonic is not visible on the spectrogram. This suggests to me that the nonlinearity that causes the modulation is somehow in the vocal chords. The problem might be somehow linked to coupled oscillators, but beyond me right now.

Do you have an intuitive explanation for this? Thanks!

Apparently, finished blood cells have to ""squeeze"" through semi-permeable tissue before they're allowed to enter the veins. I doubt this is accomplished through simple stochastic processes alone. Unfortunately, it's been difficult trying to figure out how this looks at a granular level, and I don't know where to begin.

Can we be cartain that everyone sees colors the same way? I'm not talking about colorblindness.

People usually reply with ,,we can't know"", or ,,there are slight diffrences"", but I want to know if we can reasonably assume that someone's blue might be another person's red.

I know it's technically possible, because we can't really check color interpretation differences between people, but this doesn't seem right to me. 

Could our brains really perceive colors so differently? I mean if you look at the color spectrum, blue and red are far apart. How would our brains come to such different results? Wouldn't everything have to be swapped around? 

The wavelength of red is around 700nm and the wavelength of blue is around 500nm. If some people saw red as blue, why would their brain jump from orange to blue without any colors in between?

Another thing is, wouldn't that result in a lot of people having color blindness? Chances of having colorblindness are quite low, especially if you have XX chromosomes.

We are leading the federal agency charged with setting and supporting the national agenda for mental health research and are excited to talk with you today.

[Joshua A. Gordon, M.D., Ph.D.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director) is the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). He oversees an extensive research portfolio of basic and clinical research that seeks to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. Dr. Gordon pursued a combined M.D.-Ph.D. degree at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Medical school coursework in psychiatry and neuroscience convinced him that the greatest need, and greatest promise, for biomedical science was in these areas. Dr. Gordon's research focuses on the analysis of neural activity in mice carrying mutations of relevance to psychiatric disease. His lab studied genetic models of these diseases from an integrative neuroscience perspective, focused on understanding how a given disease mutation leads to a behavioral phenotype across multiple levels of analysis. To this end, he employs a range of systems neuroscience techniques, including in vivo imaging, anesthetized and awake behavioral recordings, and optogenetics, which is the use of light to control neural activity. His research has direct relevance to schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and depression. [Follow Dr. Gordon on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/NIMHDirector).



[Shelli Avenevoli, Ph.D.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/od/about-nimh-deputy-director-shelli-avenevoli-phd), is the Deputy Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). In 2001, Dr. Avenevoli joined the NIMH intramural research program as a staff scientist in the Section of Developmental Genetic Epidemiology of the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. In 2005, she moved to the NIMH division of extramural research as Chief of the Emotion, Mood, and Depressive Disorders Program. In 2008, Dr. Avenevoli became Chief of the Developmental Trajectories of Mental Disorders Branch. She has been heavily involved in a number of key NIMH efforts, including revising NIMH's Strategic Plan, re-defining the Institute's approach to supporting research in neurodevelopment and bipolar disorder, and serving as a liaison to other agencies for special initiatives. Prior to joining NIMH, Dr. Avenevoli received her Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology from Temple University, and completed an NIMH-funded postdoctoral fellowship in psychiatric epidemiology at Yale University School of Medicine.

2. What is it about iron that makes it able to do these things? Could another kind of metal do the same thing, or does it *have* to be iron? Maybe another kind of ferromagnetic metal?

I have two quick questions about gravitational waves. Let me say up top, I realize that there's not much we know about them, so I'm perfectly satisfied with 'best guess' answers here. Obviously if there *is* a known correct answer, that's best, but if not, an answer that seems to logically make sense given what we *do* know will work fine!

Now, for the questions!

1. Do gravitational waves diminish over time? Or, rather, do the distortions they cause diminish over time (and space)? Do they start to fade like a ripple in a pond, or do they maintain their level of distorting spacetime as they expand?
2. What is your best guess for how a strong gravitational wave might affect a human body? Would it just kinda pass through a person without being noticed, since it's distorting spacetime and the person is inside spacetime? Or would you feel it, kinda like a pressure wave? Would its effects likely be more macro or micro in scope? What would be your best guess as to how this would affect a human body - or, what might you compare it to? Any medical conditions you might compare it to?

Again, I realize that there's probably very little information to go on, so if we have to resort to conjecture, I'm comfortable with that, but I'd like to base our conjecture on as reasonable information and/or assumptions as possible. So! What do you all think?",askscience

This question arises from some research I've been doing on pet food safety. There is a prominent theory that legumes/pulses (like peas, lentils, chickpeas) impact food absorption or body mechanisms in a way that causes diet-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) aka enlargening of the heart chamber in dogs and maybe cats (this started from widespread reports to the FDA about grain-free diets and non-genetic DCM cases which led to the FDA issuing an alert and investigation into this issue).

Apparently in the pet food industry, only less than a handful of brands are ever vet-recommended mainly because their ingredients and the interactions of those ingredients in those forms have been researched front and back on safety. Namely corn. 

So apparently, when mixed with meat products, corn is harmless, but legumes might be causing severe heart problems. Why is that? I know there isn't enough research on this specifically, but in a broader sense and theoretical aspect, how can food combinations do this?",askscience

The wires are still hanging, if they were fun to play with before, they’re still fun to play with now. Only difference is now there’s no current flowing, so no magnetic field. And she stopped chewing it.

Idk if this helps but I think all of the wires she bit were DC (connected to battery for the van and solar for the gate and pump). So a static magnetic field, same as Earth’s field, although sharks, for example, can still use it to navigate.

Between evaporation and precipitation it seems like this amount is kept largely in equilibrium but, during the last glacial maximum, a lot of this precipitation would have frozen to form glaciers. 

Since that precipitation didn't make it into the ocean it stands to reason that this would have increased the salinity of the oceans. And sure, if the amount of water held in the glaciers was a drop in the bucket compared to the water in the oceans then I guess it wouldn't have made much of a difference.

But, [according to USGS][3]: ""global sea level was about 125 meters below today’s sea level at the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago"".

Joining us are Lucas Eastham, M.S., Priera Panescu, Ph.D., and Bryan Quoc Le, Ph.D., who are here to answer all your questions about upcycling agricultural ""leftovers"" for the production of alternative proteins.

**Upcycling sidestreams is a critical step toward creating circular bioeconomies that produce food more efficiently, affordably, and sustainably.** The [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org/) (GFI), a nonprofit think tank working to make the global food system better for the planet, people, and animals, recently released a new report, ""[Cultivating alternative proteins from commodity crop sidestreams](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/)."" Find the GFI Sidestreams analysis report [here](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/) and webinar [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5HMeQzRU34).

The report identifies sidestreams (""leftovers"") that have tremendous potential to maximize food production via alternative proteins, while also reducing the costs and environmental impacts of agricultural waste. Specifically, this analysis identifies the optimal sidestreams candidates from North America's top crops that could be valorized for (1) protein concentrates for plant-based food ingredients, (2) protein hydrolysates for fermentation or cultivated meat media, and (3) lignocellulosic sugars for fermentation media.

This analysis highlights the major challenges associated with bringing these sidestreams into commercial use for the food industry. It also outlines strategic geographic opportunity areas and the need for public-private partnerships to fully exploit the economic and environmental potential sidestreams offer. Ultimately, the report aims to provide a landscape and actionable insights that commercial, non-profit, and public sector stakeholders can use to direct their efforts in building a sustainable, circular bioeconomy in the food industry.

[Lucas Eastham](https://gfi.org/team/lucas-eastham/) (/u/lucase-GFI) is a Senior Fermentation Scientist at The Good Food Institute, and previously worked for 10 years in microbial biotechnology bioprocess development for biofuels, biofertilizers, food ingredients, and cosmetic ingredients.

[Dr. Priera Panescu](https://gfi.org/team/priera-panescu/) (/u/Chemical_Preaction) is a Lead Scientist at The Good Food Institute. She is focused on analyzing plant-based meat and proteins, and how to expedite their progress.

369,369,1702314188.0,"Could a system exist such that the vibration of its molecules due to heat, spontaneously synchronize?","So spontaneous synchronization is the idea that multiple oscillators that are physically connected in some way, can spontaneously synchronize their oscillations. 

My question is, is it possible to construct some system such that the random vibrations of molecules due to their thermal energy could spontaneously synchronize?  Could macroscopic movement arise from these microscopic thermal vibrations?

It feels like what I'm suggesting would violate the second law of thermodynamics,  but im not entirely sure about that.  As spontaneous synchronization of any oscillators also feels like it'd violate this law yet it obviously is real.

Perhaps it is possible, but only for sufficiently small systems?  I recall from a statistical mechanics class i took years ago that certain weird phenomena were actually possible for sufficiently small systems (such as a decrease in entropy for a small collection of particles, as the more orderly microstates were far more likely simply due to the number of permutations being much smaller)

370,370,1702143527.0,Do longer trains always take longer to stop?,"I was thinking about how trains stop, the engineer pulls a lever which releases air from the brakes, which makes the wheels slow down.

Intuitively longer trains take longer to stop because they have a lot more momentum, but obviously they also have more wheels and brakes. I'm guessing that a 100 car train will have the same ""brake to weight"" ratio as a 10 car train.

I read that the delay between the lever being pulled and the air being released toward the back of the train contribute to the braking distance. Before the last car even starts braking the train has already moved forward. 

But in a perfect system where all of the brakes are applied at the same time, would a train with 100 cars take longer to stop than one with 10 cars?

After all if you had 100 semi trucks driving on a motorway and had them brake at the same time, they'd stop within the same distance as a single semi would. Is that the same for trains?",askscience

401,401,1701613280.0,"How does a ""battery box"" work to help electret microphones?","Some background and then details on my specific case:

When people record live music, there's typically a few things they carry in their kit: 1) a microphone (in some cases a pair of electret mics), 2) a ""battery box"" which provides power to the mics and passes the signal through to a 3) recording device.  Most recording devices also have their own ""mic level"" power, but ""tapers"" highly recommend using a battery box and turning off the power from the recorder if possible.

&#x200B;

My questions are: what does a battery box do and is it really important in my setup described below?  Is there anything I can do to improve my design, like using different resistors - i.e., would 3-6K resistors (or even lower) be better?

In my case, I'm making my own ""battery box"" using info available online.  It basically has [this](https://i.imgur.com/SUswVO6.jpg) layout.  I am using a 12v (21/23) battery and 9.1K resistors, along with capacitors of sizes ranging from 22pF to 1uF (I've built several on the premise that the 22pF caps help provide bass roll-off, while the 1uF do not).  I kinda understand the purpose of the caps (at least in theory), but it's the resistors that I'm confused about, and ultimately how important the battery box is in this setup.

When measuring the inherent ""mic level"" output of my recorder (a Roland R-07), I see 2v and what looks like \~0.015ma.  This would directly feed the mics in the absence of a battery box.

With the battery box (12v battery + 9.1K resistors), I see 12v and \~0.10ma.

The electret mics I'm using typically have 2.2K impedance, require 1-10V, and use ~0.5mA max current.  A schematic of one set of mics I'm using is found [here](https://i.imgur.com/aibNo3C.jpg).  I've tried some prototypes of both the mics and the battery box out, and the recordings sound fine when recording volumes loud enough to require ear plugs - no clipping or anything, but I wonder what the resistors are doing and if the 9.1K ones I've chosen are the best for this application.

E: corrected some values.

The curve in an absorbance spectra, as opposed a straight line at an exact frequency, can be explained by the doppler effect. If light is absorbed in an orbital at X frequency and you shoot light with a frequency of 0.95 X at the orbital, if the molecule is moving towards the light source at a certain speed, the doppler effect will increase the effective frequency to X from the perspective. Works similarly if you shoot light with a frequency of 1.05 X and the molecule is moving away.

There's uncertainty in every measurement. When you measure a liter of water, you can say a liter, or be more precise, say 1.0 liters, and then 1.02 liters, 1.018 liters, etc. You can always get more and more precise.

As people around the world gather together for food-rich holidays, we wonder: **Can we feed this growing world without starving the planet?**

Do you think it could be part of future sustainable Thanksgiving meals?

My hypothesis is that a car with all other factors the same including air density on a level plane will accelerate faster in slightly higher G environments than in slightly lower G environments. This hypothesis assumes that traction is a limiting factor of acceleration for this vehicle.

My reason for this hypothesis is that in higher G environments weight and therefore traction would increase but mass would remain unchanged. This would prevent the vehicle from spinning it's wheels off the line resulting in faster acceleration times than a lower G vehicle and since mass is unchanged it would have negligible impact on horizontal acceleration. They argue that since the vehicle would have more weight (not mass) it would be substantially slower.

PFAS are used in hundreds of everyday products-from fabric protectors, electronics and non-stick pans to foams, tapes and even toilet paper. PFAS are called ""forever chemicals"" because the properties that make them so useful to consumers make them very persistent in the environment.

In the Bloomberg Originals video documentary The Poison In Us All, we reveal how the chemicals - which have been linked to cancer and are the subject of sweeping litigation - ended up inside the bodies of almost everyone on the planet.

Litigation has revealed documents showing that its manufacturers, including industrial giant 3M, had dumped the chemicals for years and have been aware of the dangers associated with PFAS. 3M has said its products ""are safe and effective for their intended uses"" and assailed plaintiffs' lawyers for selectively citing documents to portray ""an incomplete and misleading story about 3M's actions.""

This may be a silly question, but I am interested in learning if a forensic scientist will be able to tell if a vial of blood is drawn from a living person or a person who has recently died. 

Imagine a room with a living person and someone who has recently died (a little over 1 hour), and a forensic scientist arrives blindfolded (with all the testing equipment he may need). If I draw blood from either the living person or the recently deceased and give it to the scientist, will he be able to tell where the blood came from based on the ""freshness""?

Today most fertile lands (mollisols) are located in Canada and Eurasian prairies but as far as we know, these are not where Neolithic Revolution first took place. Was there more important factors for progenitors of first domesticated plants, such as growing season suitability, population density, paleolithic tools etc., or when Holocene started, these middle latitude regions had mollisols already but later lost their fertility? 

I assume complex interplay of different factors are offered by different scholars without a consensus but any answer or suggestion for academic publication is welcome.

So I've been watching deep sea documentary videos. And they say Challenger Deep is 12000 meters down and almost freezing. But the furthest down we've been able to drill is 11000 meters, and as far as I understand it, the heat was the biggest obstacle preventing going further. Plus unless I'm just misunderstanding everything, shouldn't higher pressures increase temperature? 

So how is the deepest depths not hotter than a couple degrees? My first thought was the hot water would rise and cooler water would come down to take it's place, but that would cause like constant sideways tornadoes of water. So I searched if vertical currents were a thing. I found upwellings and downwellings. But most of what I could find was related to shallower water nearer the coast.

What’s happening on a molecular level? I don’t do well with abstract thought so I’ll provide an “experiment” and hopefully someone clever can explain it to me.

Say I have two dry kidney beans. I put one on a sunny windowsill on a hot day and I put the other one in the freezer. An hour later, I take both beans and put them side by side on a plate on the kitchen table. After some time, they both return to room temperature. 

My questions are numbered but you don’t have to answer them directly like this, it just makes it easier for me:

1. If I put the beans under a super strong microscope that could show me the molecules (or whatever level we’d have to be observing to see what we want to see) while they were still hot/cold, how could I recognize by observation alone which one was hot and which one was cold?

2. What would the molecules in each bean do as it cooled/warmed up, respectively?

3. If the beans on the plate existed in a small vacuum universe, just big enough for the beans and a few cubic inches of air around them, how would their respective temperatures effect each other or the air as their temperature equalized? Would you be able to see the air around the hot bean heat up as the hot bean itself cools down, and what would that look like?

4. What causes temperature to equalize (why do hot things cool down, why do cold things warm up?)

Side notes for those interested. After the yeast peaks in activity it will move to an air locked environment to encourage alcohol production and give time for the yeast to break down the fructose, which takes longer.

In high school chemistry we are given the knowledge and run on the assumption that electrons are solid objects orbiting various levels of energy from the nucleus, and things like donating electrons in ionic bonding and covalent bonding is the sharing of valence electrons to allow both atoms to reach the maximum number of electrons in a certain shell.

Once I got to slightly more advanced physics and understood the wave-particle behavior of electrons, I cannot make the link between how the bonding works when the concept of an electron can now be described as a field. Does it just bypass this entire concept together, only interacting as the particle section of the wave-particle duality?

For context I was thinking about lightspeed and how its impossible to go faster than it but I got this idea into my head and I can't get it out.

Imagine a Seesaw floating in outer space, the ""plank"" is perfectly rigid and the plank its 2 lightseconds long. If I were to push down on one end of the seesaw, would the other end go up 2 seconds later or would it start moving at the same time? (asuming that the center doesnt move down when you push it down).  Also, what would happen if I just push the whole seesaw from the center down, would ends of it go down at the same time or would they go down a second later?

I don't understand enough to actually come up with an answer, so if someone could help me understand this, provably stupid question, that would be amazing.

Thanks!

Edit: First of all thank you to everyone that answered this, some of it goes over my head but I feel like I have learned a lot, so thank you everyone who took the time to answer my question.

Second, just to dispel a misconception, I asked this question out of ignorance not as a gotcha to relativity or to just make stuff up. I was not aware that a perfectly rigid object was such an impossibility that it breaks physics, in my ignorance I thought that saying perfectly rigid was akin to disregarding friction in an equation to makes things simpler. I now understand that that was VERY dumb of me, so sorry about that. But hey I learned something new so thanks everyone.

I understand that seasons are caused by the tilt of the earth causing the North hemisphere to receive more sunlight than the south hemisphere for half a year and vice versa. Would it be possible for a planet to orbit a star in a way that the axis is always leaning towards the sun? I believe this would mean that the planet is orbiting around one axis (such as north and south poles) as well as another axis perpendicular to the plane of the orbit allowing the north pole to always be angled towards the sun. Would the axis of the north and south poles have to intersect with the star for this to be achieved, or could the angle of the axis be angled above or below the star?

i read that the fine structure is cause by corrections due to relativistic considerations (along with spin contribution).

here's my issue: arent the electrons in the atomic structure standing waves? as in, they are not propagating, so there is no relative velocity between them and the frame of reference (the nucleus).

my understanding is that the electrons can't be moving because if they were then they'd be radiating due to moving through the nucleus' E-field, which they aren't. not to mention if they ARE in motion then they're also all moving relative to each other's E-field in a multi-e system.

By contrast from what I’ve seen the Rockies and Western Ranges seem to be dominated by wide expansive open valleys filled with dry grassland and prairie or at least they seem to be far more common than they are here in the East.

**[Gerald (Jerry) Wilkinson](https://biology.umd.edu/people/gerald-wilkinson)** is a professor in the University of Maryland Department of Biology who conducts research on social behavior, with emphasis on how genetic mechanisms may influence the outcome of evolution. He has studied several species of bats, including vampire bats, in the Neotropics and the US to understand cooperative behavior and communication. Recently, his lab has used DNA methylation to predict age in bats and discovered that extreme longevity, which has evolved in multiple bat lineages, is associated with changes in methylation near genes involved in immunity. Current projects aim to identify epigenetic changes associated with social stress, immune function, and sex differences in aging in bats.

**Katherine Armenta** is a third-year Ph.D. student in the University of Maryland Behavior, Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics program (BEES). She is studying one of the most abundant bat species in Maryland, Eptesicus fuscus, or the big brown bat, and its communication and social behavior within and across species.

**Danielle Adams** is a postdoc in the Wilkinson Lab at the University of Maryland. She is studying the interactions between stress, aging, and immunity in wild bats. During her Ph.D. (UMD '19), she studied sexual selection in phyllostomid bats, a diverse family of leaf-nosed bat species found in the Neotropics. Prior to studying bats, Danielle studied vocal communication and the use of imitation in wild parrots. She also holds a master's in conservation biology (Columbia University '10).

The trend is clear - more modern methods of wireless communication use higher frequency waves, with less range.

Am I correct in assuming this is because at high frequencies, even if you only occupy a small portion of the frequency you still got a huge bandwidth? And using the traditional Long Wave, Medium Wave and Short Wave frequencies, just how good of a bitrate could be achieved if instead of transmitting sound a digital mode using all advances in modern technology (most modern modulation etc.) are used?

625,625,1697762036.0,Why were lines of longitude defined differently from lines of latitude? (ie not parallel),"I understand that lines of longitude converge at the poles, but why were they made to do that when lines of latitude run parallel to each other? 

Or maybe what I want to know is, why don’t we have another set of lines that run north and south but remain parallel to each other? 

I think I can understand why you don’t need converging lines that run east to west, but if parallel lines are helpful running east and west, wouldn’t they be helpful running north and south too?

Edit: Apologies that this is so unclear, it was very hard to find the wording to convey my question. Maybe what I should have asked is, why is it helpful to  measure latitudinally using nearly cylindrical parallel divisions, where we measure the earth longitudinally in converging divisions that make a shape like an orange carpel (again, I am running out of words here).

Second Edit: CrustalTrudger helped me understand that the lines of longitude and latitude were defined as they were primarily because of their relation to the sun and the poles and their usefulness in navigation. The lines of longitude are not just measuring the difference between places on the earth, but  instead are something like tracking the places which are directly under the sun at the same time. This would have been more practical at the time than covering the globe in a grid of arbitrary parallel lines. The latitudinal lines are even distances from the equator which has significance in relation to both the sun and the poles.",askscience
626,626,1697740825.0,Doesn't this violate the equivalence principle?,"I'm sorry if this has been asked before, I searched on Reddit and Google and could not find this question asked.

If two stationary balls are in a box which has a complete vacuum in deep space, ignoring the gravity of the balls for each other, the balls will just sit in the same spots forever.

However if the balls in the vacuum in the box were freefalling in an orbit around the earth, because the balls independently have elliptical orbits around the earth, they should move towards each other and then away from each other, oscillating back and forth.

Wouldn't this distinguish the first and second scenarios and thus violate Einstein's Equivalence principle? Thanks.

630,630,1697732457.0,How would we know if we were moving at near light speeds?,"If I am walking 5km/h in a train that is moving 100km/h I'm really moving 105km/h relative to the earth. But the earth is moving 107,000 km/h relative to the sun so in a way I'm moving 107105km/h. But our solar system is moving 200,000km/s through the milky way so add that also... etc, etc etc.  
Now I realize that the speed of light is the fastest anything can move. And I know that time changes depending on the speed you are going. But I have also been led to believe that the object that is moving at great speed is experiencing time slower than those moving slower, yet to the object itself time still seems to move the same while the outside world form its perspective seems to speed up.

  
1. Since speed is relative and there is no fixed point to use as a speed of zero, if a planet was already moving at near light speed relative to another point in space how would its inhabitants even know that they were moving that fast?

  
2. If I, along with my world, was already moving this fast would my interpretation of light speed still just be an additional 300,000km/s relative to me?

  
3. What does this mean for the passage of time on other planets that are moving at a different speed through the universe relative to Earth?",askscience

Some of those planets are speculated to have ocean-like liquids. Now that's just a scientist's guess when they gather info about the exoplanet, but like with Coral reefs being visible from space, can the same be possible from, let's say footages of these planets? Like, zooming on the footage and observing the oceans from there?

However, I'm aware that if those planets had something similar like Coral reefs here, we could identify alien life already. To simplify the question, if we find an alien planet with oceans, would it be likely that we could find some visible life activity from space footage, similar to coral reefs on Earth?

Srsly nature is nasty) and so on. Learning that trans genus trans family and sometimes trans order hybrids were possible blew my mind, and left me with difficult questions about how and why we classify animals.

By that definition, isn't the protoplasm just the cell? at least in a cell without a cell wall that description includes every single part of a cell, so what's even the point of the word protoplasm?

Initially, the particle seems sensible - it's a packet of waves that behaves like a particle in the aggregate. But once it starts scattering, nothing makes sense to me anymore.

1. It is my understanding that particles are discrete - you can't have half a photon. But in this simulation, the scattering pushes half of it through the lattice and half reflects backwards!

2. Scattering seems to disperse the energy of the particle over a large (and infinitely expanding) area of space. Is the particle destroyed after this? I didn't think particles could be destroyed. 

3. What would happen if you observed this particle after the scattering? Would all these waves collapse into a single discrete particle again? How does this process work?",askscience

669,2,1591120666.0,Black Lives Matter,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.

670,3,1686543618.0,AskScience’s concerns regarding Reddit’s API changes,"In April 2023, [Reddit announced they would begin charging for its application programming interface (API)
access](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/technology/reddit-ai-openai-google.html).

API is used to allow different applications to interact with each other. We are a heavily moderated subreddit, and we use API access for moderation, AMA organisation, and insights into our community. We are using community-driven tools which use the API in order to make management of a community as large as /r/askscience practical for our group of volunteer moderators.

At the same time, we recognise both Reddit's mission as a corporation, as well as the dangers and risks arising from access to the API. Reddit is looking for ways to [monetize its user-generated content](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/upcoming-reddit-blackout-and-future-third-party-applications); the Times article linked above notes has been used to train high-profile machine learning models like OpenAI's.

While Reddit administration has mentioned [free access for moderation tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/), we believe their current approach of gatekeeping access based on arbitrary and indiscriminate rate limiting has several shortcomings:  
It disproportionately impacts people who use Reddit with accommodations, such as screen readers: Reddit has stated that [accessibility-focused apps will be exempt from the new restrictions](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/reddit-makes-an-exception-for-accessibility-apps-under-new-api-terms/) but has offered little clarity on what that means for this rapidly-approaching change  
It does not reflect Reddit’s promise to [support moderation
  tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/)  
It does not establish clear and concise criteria for what is legitimate API usage  

We also remain cognisant of Reddit’s past promises to [improve communication with
moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/) and build tools for us to improve search and combat hateful rhetoric, anti-vaccination, and COVID denialism. While Reddit has banned hate speech and banned communities spreading science denialism, we feel they have not delivered on moderation tools and support. We feel that 3rd-party tools still offer superior support for moderation as well as accessibility features.

Everyone in the /r/askscience community contributes to its quality and longevity by volunteering their time and expertise to question, answer, and moderate scientific discussion. We feel the Reddit administration does a disservice our passion for large-scale, high-quality science communication by [pursuing a unilateral and opaque
direction](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/). This damages our community and ultimately Reddit itself by severing the trust we place upon it as a platform for science education and outreach.

One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place.

Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

FAQ:

> Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

> Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:

1. There is a scene in which a character touches someone who has been affected by nuclear radiation with their hand. When they pull their hand away, their palm and fingers have already begun to turn red with radiation sickness.

2. There is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness.

**Is actual radiation contamination *that* contagious?** [This article](https://www.livescience.com/13444-radiation-exposure-contagious.html) seems to indicate that it's nearly impossible to deliver radiation via skin-to-skin contact, and that as long as a sick person washes their skin and clothes, they're safe to be around, even if they've inhaled or ingested radioactive material that is still in their bodies.

This has always confused me. Where do our anglicanized names like these come from and how confident are we that this is what these historical and mythological figures were called by ancient peoples?

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.

First of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, ""Tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""Tawat 'ankhu qaman"" ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).

* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point. 

Thanks so much for all the great answers, everyone. It totally answered my question and questions I didn't know I had. ",askscience

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) — a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration — was designed to capture images of a black hole. Today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, EHT researchers have revealed that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.

The image reveals the black hole at the centre of Messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. This black hole resides 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun

I don't mean this in any sort of combative way–the Human Genome Project had countless benefits that we can't possibly track, and I'd imagine $2.7 billion is a trifle compared to its broader impact. 

My question is just narrowly about the way that genome sequencing has dropped rapidly in cost. Was it fundamentally necessary to first use these exorbitantly pricey methods, which provided the foundation for the future research which would make it affordable? Or are the two questions inherently separate: the Human Genome Project gave us a first, initial glimpse at our mapped out genome, and then a decade later separate technological developments would make that same task much cheaper (as is commonly the case in science and technology).

The ""could we have waited"" in the title is probably misleading–I really don't mean any sort of  value judgment (the project sounds enormously important), I purely mean ""could"" in a narrow hypothetical (not, ""would it have been a good idea to wait"", which I highly doubt).",askscience

*Summary:* We are a team of astronomers running a campaign called the Pale Red Dot. We have found definitive evidence of a planet in orbit around the closest star to Earth, besides the Sun. The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System. 

Our results have just been published today in Nature, but our observing campaign lasted from mid January to April 2016. We have kept a blog about the entire process here: [www.palereddot.org](http://www.palereddot.org/) and have also communicated via Twitter @Pale_Red_Dot and Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/](https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/)

1061,394,1600254051.0,AskScience AMA Series: We have hints of life on Venus. Ask Us Anything!,"An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial ""aerial"" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.

Signs of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.

Details on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2015/

We are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery. We will be available on Wednesday, 16 September, starting with 16:00 UTC, 18:00 CEST (Central European Summer Time), 12:00 EDT (Eastern Daylight Time). Ask Us Anything!

Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.

Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.

So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.

Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.

So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.

Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?

Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.

The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.

1129,462,1539616254.0,Prosthetics: Can someone born without a limb (rather than losing it after birth) use advanced prosthetics controlled by nerves and neural pathways?,"I understand (or at least, I think I do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.  Let's say instead, however, that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defect/genetic condition.  At no point have they had an elbow, or forearm, hand... If he are she is born this way I presume that there is no neural pathways/nerves to dock onto.  I am sure that technology will continue to advance so I guess I am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.

The inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  He utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  A very heart warming video.  Many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.  But one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them.

Any thoughts?

**EDIT:** Thanks so much for the response everybody!  This is my very first post to reddit after years of lurking... First, let me say that I was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much I understood about this subject at a base level.  To clarify the question, I believe what I was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic. That seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  I will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. While I am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately:

Can someone born without a limb as opposed to losing a limb later in life use myoelectric prosthetics? Why or Why not?",askscience

I wonder, why exactly does this happen. Is it related to the fact that overweight people are often less active (don't exercise much, have sedentary lifestyle, etc - so, for example, their respiratory system is more susceptible to the impact of the virus) or does it have something to do with being overweight in general (hormones, metabolism or something else) ? 

&#x200B;

Why do I ask: I'm overweight, I started to exercise regularly since spring and dropped about 9 kg/19 pounds so far. Such tasks like going upstairs or running are much easier now, but my weight is still above the norm for my age/height. So I wonder if I've lowered the risk of getting the severe form of covid-19.

They represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.

I made a drawing to make my question clearer : [Drawing](http://imgur.com/a/C84eq)

 *The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.*

 *The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.*

 * The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited

 * On the second line of the ""comic"" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !

 * On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?

Nowadays people are less physically active, and the rate of depression has been rising. Physical exercise is regularly advised as a remedy for depression and other mental health issues. Could it therefore be, that normal mental health requires a ""homeostatic"" amount of physical activity? Does sedentary lifestyle play a part in the grand scheme of more people becoming depressed?

I was thinking about something recently. If we have a universe of 2D space that us as three-dimensional beings can look at, we can interact with that universe but only in a distorted kind of sense. A 3D object casts a 2D shadow. A 3D object moving through the plane of a 2D universe would appear to a 2D being as something that appears from nowhere, changes shape, and eventually disappears into nothingness.

We haven't found a 2D plane of existence to test this out on, of course, and, as far as I know, We haven't ever seen a four-dimensional object cast a three-dimensional ""Shadow."" At least, as far as I know.

I've seen some people postulate about 5, 6, even 10 spatial dimensions. But if these dimensions actually existed, shouldn't we have seen, by now, some form of evidence of them? Or have we seen three-dimensional ""shadows"" of four-dimensional objects and I'm just unaware?",askscience

1242,575,1560248895.0,Is there any record of any object from earth being ejected to space by natural forces?,"I have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations: 

**1. The Moon**

>u/Chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the Earth, in the form of our moon. Simulations (e.g. [Canup & Asphaug 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35089010.pdf), [Cuk & Stewart 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1047/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. [Wiechert et al., 2001](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly Mars-sized) object collided with the proto-Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-Mantle and proto-Crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.

 **2. A Moon rock which is actually an Earth meteorite**

> u/yellowstone10: Some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a Moon rock collected by the crew of Apollo 14 was probably ejected from the Earth about 4 billion years ago. [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  
>  
>u/foramsgalorams: In January of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from Apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from Earth within it! This would make it an Earth meteorite which struck the Moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. This would have happened like a game of Solar System pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking Earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the Moon. Radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in Earth’s 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the Theia-Earth impact event which formed the Moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. You can read more on the details [here](https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19300202). 

**3. Moldavite – Rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**

> u/aa_unfiltered: Moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. It formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in Germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. [https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite](https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) 

**4. Hydrogen and Helium** 

>u/SlowerThanLightSpeed: ""Jean's escape"" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\_escape#Jeans\_Escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_Escape)   
>  
>Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\[10\] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\[10\] but a Japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth.\[11\] 

**Also Volcanoes apparently DO NOT have enough force to eject matter into space** 

>u/Clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a ""supervolcano"" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. Most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - [http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) 
>
>u/KnowanUKnow : It's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. The most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. Subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. Not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. I thought Krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of TNT. But even that isn't enough. It literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 Hiroshimas (or 4 Tsar Bombs) and even that isn't enough. There's something called a Verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a Verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed.

TIL: the iconic ""dive-bomber diving"" sound we all know is actually the sound of a [WWII German Ju87 Stuka Dive Bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87). It was the sound of a siren placed on the plane's gear legs and was meant to instil fear and hopefully make the enemy scatter instead of shooting back.

With this in mind, why would a doctor prescribe a medicine that reduces your fever? Is this just to make you feel less terrible, or does this actually help fight the infection?

1293,626,1647860461.0,"AskScience AMA Series: We've discovered that pancreatic cancer is detectable based on microbes in stool, with the potential for earlier screening in the future. AUA!","Hi Reddit! We are Ece Kartal (u/psecekartal), Sebastian Schmidt (u/TSBSchm) and Esther Molina-Montes (u/memmontes). We are lead authors on a recently published study showing that non-invasive (and early) detection of pancreatic cancer may be possible using stool samples. Ask Us Anything!

Pancreatic cancer is a horrible disease: although few people develop this form of cancer, only around 1 in 20 patients survive for 5 years or longer after diagnosis. This is in part due to late detection: symptoms are unspecific and often occur only when the disease has already progressed to advanced stages, so that diagnosis if often too late for therapeutic intervention (surgery and/or chemotherapy). This makes the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer an important goal in mitigating the disease, yet no approved non-invasive or minimally invasive, inexpensive tests currently exist.

We studied a Spanish population of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, the most common form of pancreatic cancer) and clinically matched controls that were either pancreas-healthy or suffered from chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas, an important risk factor for the development for PDAC). We found that a set of 27 microbial species detected in feces provide a very specific signature for PDAC patients, even in early stages. When combined with a blood serum-based cancer progression (not diagnostic) marker, prediction accuracy increased even further. We confirmed this finding in an independent German cohort, and also made sure that this microbiome signature did not falsely predict PDAC among thousands of subjects that were either healthy or suffered from other diseases. Moreover, we were able to trace some of these signature microbes between mouth, pancreatic healthy tissue, pancreatic tumors, and the gut which suggests that they may be more than just indicators.

Our study is freely available online in the journal GUT (Kartal, Schmidt, Molina-Montes, et al; 2022): https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/01/26/gutjnl-2021-324755

A commentary by R. Newsome and C. Jobin in the same issue puts our work into context: https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/02/21/gutjnl-2021-326710

For less formal introductions, check the press releases by one of our funding bodies ([Worldwide Cancer Research](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/news-opinion/2022/march/microorganisms-in-stool-samples-could-offer-new-way-to-detect-pancreatic-cancer-early/)) or the lead institutions [EMBL Heidelberg, Germany](https://www.embl.org/news/science/an-international-study-proposes-stool-analysis-for-early-detection-of-pancreatic-cancer/) and [CNIO Madrid, Spain (text in Spanish)]( https://www.cnio.es/noticias/una-colaboracion-internacional-propone-un-analisis-de-heces-para-la-deteccion-temprana-del-cancer-de-pancreas/).

Our work is an early proof of principle and will need to be further validated on larger and independent cohorts. Yet our findings hold some promise for a future inexpensive, non-invasive screening method for pancreatic cancer. Such a screen could initially target risk groups, e.g. above a certain age or with a family history of PDAC. Ideally, with further development and in combination with other biomarkers, our approach might be developed into an actionable diagnosis method in the future. That said, none of us is a medical doctor; we cannot and will not provide any medical advice, and none of what we post here should be construed as such.

**Edit:** So far in this thread, we have two points being made on the usefullness of the masks: 

1. They prevent hand to mouth/nose touching. 

2. They prevent saliva, mucus/phlegm projection into someone's face, as well as receiving some from the projection of others in close quarters.

Sounds good to me. 

So yes, they are useful, but not as a definitive deterent for airborn disease.

I was outside for all of twenty minutes as tightly and hotly bundled as a human can be and my eyelashes froze and I thought I'd freeze solid if I had to stay outside for an hour. I could hardly see where I was going while I was walking into the wind I had to keep blinking and wiping the ice away.

All the while I saw dozen of birds out flying around, in the few patches of river that hadn't frozen yet and flying in the air above. It was -20 give or take when I went out, and that's peanuts compared to what it was overnight, but these birds clearly survived that. How do they manage it?

This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from?

My lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7uNbjg

My lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.

One of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. 

By producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.

How do cats inherently know how to use a litter box? I saw videos on kittens and how they figure out how to use them in like 8 weeks. So they genuinely know how to use it almost from the beginning. 

I can't think of a litter box like thing in the ""wild"" so I'm really curious. Also how do they recognize that as their new bathroom? Like they had to have some alternative to what they normally would use, so how do they know that is where they're supposed to go?

Random idea just popped into my mind - since we've developed fibre optics - a way of transmitting data by sending light patterns with energy loss close to 0 - why can't we use principles such as TIR (total internal reflection) to collect large amounts of light (sunlight) and then store it similar to how the superconductor bank works? 

If we could be able to store light as a form of energy - could be collected, amplified by using mirrors and be a source of sustainable energy much alike solar panels (quite inefficient).

1440,773,1597904280.0,Do mosquitos hide in predictable locations?,"I've noticed that if there's a mosquito in the room, and I swat at it but fail to kill it, it usually seems to disappear for about 30 minutes before it tries to come after me again.

I'm curious how programmed or predictable mosquito behaviors are. For example, does it actually have a behavior like ""if swatted at, lay low for 30 minutes before trying again?"" Or am I just imagining the correlation? Second, if they do have a ""hide"" behavior, do they choose predictable locations? Do they prefer corners of the room? Areas with less light (do they even use light in making their decisions)? Do they go low to the ground? High on the ceiling? Do they use air currents and calmness to choose a spot?

It seems like I usually find mosquitos hiding out in a shadowy corner near the floor of the room, which is infuriating because if it would just hang out in the open against the white, well-lit wall, it would be a lot easier to hunt them down. This correlation could definitely just be my own confirmation bias at play, though, so I'm curious if much is known on this topic.

EDIT: Thank you for the lovely replies so far! I just wanted to clarify that I'm not actually that interested in \*where\* mosquitos hide in a descriptive sense, I'm more interested in how and ""why"" they make their decisions... like which senses do they use most (vision, smell, touch), and do they actually have different phases like hunting vs. hiding, or are they just sort of always doing the same thing and flying around aimlessly until they detect prey, then go for an attack?

EDIT 2: Well this post blew up! You may notice that it's a bit of a comment graveyard... sorry but askscience has strict commenting policies and the mods had to remove most of the replies. The vast majority of replies were either 1) personal tips for hunting mosquitoes, or 2) personal anecdotes on where mosquitoes hide. 

Precisely one comment linked to an actual scientific research article (thank you /u/Hillsbottom!) showing that at the very least mosquitoes can learn to associate being swatted at with certain chemical odors, and then avoid the source of those odors (people) in the future.

I didn't feel satisfied so I spent a few hours trawling the literature... turns out there's simply no research on this topic! We know a great deal about mosquito hunting behavior and how it finds its target, but seemingly nothing on hiding behavior. It's not even clear whether there exists a ""hiding"" behavioral program, or if they're just sort of always on the hunt and are just updating their attraction/aversion biases in response to swats, etc. 

However, after reading up on it I do think it's safe to say that the majority of the hunting/hiding behaviors are instinctual and not learned. It turns out adult mosquitoes are only alive and hunting for \~2-4 days before they stop and spend several days digesting + laying eggs (they typically repeat this hunt/rest cycle \~3-4 times before they die). Furthermore, a mosquito can collect all the blood it needs in one meal if left undisturbed, so in reality it typically only feeds on 1-5 people before stopping. Therefore, even though to us it seems like mosquitoes are constantly present and attacking us, from a single mosquito's perspective it may only ever encounter a few humans (less than 10) in its life cycle, and over the course of only a few days. That isn't a lot of data for the mosquito to ""learn"" with. So, if the possible answers to my original question are 1) it's random, 2) they have instinct-driven preferences for hiding, with a lot of variation between regions/species, or 3) they learn where to hide from experience, we can probably rule out #3.

AMA!","Hi Reddit! I’m [Brian Hare](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/people/brian-hare), and I’m here to talk about canine cognition and how ordinary and extraordinary dog behaviors reveal the role of cognition in the rich mental lives of dogs. The scientific community has made huge strides in our understanding of dogs’ cognitive abilities – I’m excited to share some of the latest and most fascinating – and sometimes surprising – discoveries with you. Did you know, for example, that some dogs can  learn words like human infants? Or some dogs can detect cancer? What makes dogs so successful at winning our hearts?
 
A bit more about me: I’m an associate professor at Duke University where I founded and direct the [Duke Canine Cognition Center](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/research/dogs), which is the first center in the U.S. dedicated to studying how dogs think and feel. Our work is being used to improve training techniques, inform ideas about canine cognitive health and identify the best service and bomb detecting dogs.  I helped reveal the love and bond mechanism between humans and dogs. Based on this research, I co-founded [Dognition](https://www.dognition.com), an online tool featuring fun, science-based games that anyone with a dog can use to better understand how their dog thinks compared to other dogs. 
 
Let’s talk about the amazing things dogs can do and why – Ask Me Anything!
 
For background: Please learn more about me in [my bio here](https://www.dognition.com/brian-hare) or check me out in the new podcast series [DogSmarts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dogsmarts/id1115304038?mt=2) by Purina Pro Plan on iTunes and Google Play to learn more about dog cognition.

1552,885,1588015220.0,Does gravity have a range or speed?,"So, light is a photon, and it gets emitted by something (like a star) and it travels at ~300,000 km/sec in a vacuum. I can understand this. Gravity on the other hand, as I understand it, isn't something that's emitted like some kind of tractor beam, it's a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object. So, what I'm wondering is, is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect. Does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of it's gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat? Or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object, if very neglegable, even if it's a great distance away? And if so, does that gravity move at some kind of speed, and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one? Additional mass isn't being created in such an event, but is ""new gravity"" being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object?

I realize that it's entirely possible that my concept of gravity is way off so please correct me if that's the case. This is something that's always interested me but I could never wrap my head around.

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNe2Ae5a2c) of some bursting bubbles in slow-motion. Notice that the bursting edge recedes from the initiation point; the intact surface remains unaffected until the bursting edge reaches it.

For simplicity, assume a *perfect bubble*:

- Perfectly spherical
- Evenly distributed surface
- No external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium)
- ""Pop"" or burst initiated from a single point on the surface

It seems intuitive that the *upper limit* would be the **speed of sound** for whatever medium the bubble was made from, because the speed of sound would be the physical limit that the information could be passed along that the bubble was popping.

It also usually happens in the middle of typing. It never happened, for me, on first letters I typed. And, I am sure my finger did not touch the screen in a way i just did not feel it. When it happened i was surely away from screen, that is why it always jumps out when it happens. It is always unexpected.

Edit2:
I can surely replicate phone registering very soft touches (without me feeling actually touching it) but those random ones I am experiencing are different, the finger is always a lot further away than when i can register a touch without feeling it by testing. A lot may be very relative term but that is how it feels to me, i am not really sure how far the finger actually is because it usually happens really fast and its hard to measure so small distances with feelings. So, there is a small chance that i am imagining it.

If the tilt were fixed, how much colder would the winter hemisphere get? How much hotter would the summer hemisphere get? How close do we get to whatever the ""equilibrium winter/summer"" would be?

*I know this is impossible*, I know that it would require the Earth's rotation to actually constantly be changing, which couldn't happen and would cause some other maybe catastrophic things to happen if you were to somehow force it to happen.

So, have you ever wanted to know what it's like to fly a helicopter on another planet? Or what it's like to [talk to the helicopter](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/385/keeping-our-sense-of-direction-dealing-with-a-dead-sensor/) from here on Earth? Or what we've learned from Ingenuity that can be used for possible future aerial exploration on other worlds?

Meet our NASA experts from the mission who've seen it all.

1684,19,1708991974.0,How is the Milky Way on a collision course with Andromeda?,"So after the Big Bang, everything was sent shooting off at a zillion miles per hour in all different directions. Since everything was going in an outward trajectory from the point of the Big Bang (if space is even considered to have existed then), and assuming there's no/negligible drag on a galaxy zooming through space, how would the velocities of Milky Way and Andromeda change to now be directed towards the point of collision? The only thing I can think of is if they're pulling on each other via gravity, but that seems unlikely given their distance of 2.537 million lightyears.

Can a galaxy's trajectory through space curve?

Are both the Milky Way and Andromeda headed in the same direction, and one is catching up to the other? But if that's the case, why would one of them be slowing down?",askscience

It is generally considered the “standard” for all outgassing testing criteria, at least in my field. 

What I am struggling to understand is why the TML (total mass loss) is adjusted down based on the WVR (water vapor recovered)? 

The process states that the test sample will be exposed to a 50% RH environment for 24 hours then put into the test environment, which is some X hours at some T temperature (can’t remember exactly what these values are). 

The mass lost in the test environment relative to the mass after the 24hr exposure to 50% RH is the TML. 

Afterwards, there is an “optional” step where the sample is re-exposed to the same 50% RH environment for 24hrs and its mass is measured again. The mass regained can then be deducted from the previously calculated TML to get the adjusted value. 

Why is this allowed? Does outgassing in space not care about water vapor? If so, why not? ",askscience

Then I thought about how woodpeckers protect themselves with their tongue as padding. I wondered why humans hadn’t evolved a similar soft tissue padding inside their skulls before realizing we didn’t have much need for it as head injuries probably weren’t a common cause of death in our history. Then I thought about how Neanderthals are said to have bigger brains and I’m assuming we think that because they had larger skulls and assumed it must’ve been filled with more Brian’s. But I’ve heard they were able to take much larger blows, say from a big animal, and survive. Being knocked around because of an insistence to use melee combat when hunting as opposed to spear probably would result in alot of deaths due to head injuries. So my question is, is there a possibility that they had larger skulls to make room for a kind of soft tissue padding for their brains?

When we get a cut or burn, the wound seals, but even if it is bad, such as a whole hand injury, you generally don't get fingers fusing together. I would attribute some to movement, but this doesn't solve every case. There are people that can't eat or talk and their teeth are normal. There are people that are immobilize after serious injury and they heal normally.

Adult humans should have no more than [2,300mg salt per day](https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet), which I assume is related to how much salt the kidney can (safely) filter. (I couldn't find anything related to the kidney's salt-filtration power after several minutes of googling.)

By my flawed logic, humans should be able to drink some small amount of sea water, excrete the excess salt using a fraction of the sea water consumed, and then keep the remaining desalinated sea water for hydration.

Using hard numbers: Consume 25ml of sea water containing \~875mg salt, urinate \~3ml of water containing all \~875mg of salt, keep \~22ml water for hydration.

Even if salt can't be excreted at the density at which it can be dissolved, there's still room for more water to be used for urination that's also less than the amount consumed.

Is it feasible to analyze the aged whiskey and then synthetically mature a young whisky by adding in the identified congeners?,"Its my understanding (please correct me if Im wrong) that the difference between diluted ethanol and an alcoholic drink (say whisky) is the presence of congeners - a complex mix of dissolved compounds that develop during production and maturation. Break-down of fermentation/distillation products and the acquisition of solutes present in the oak casks, result in a highly complex mixture of compounds. These compounds, collectively referred to as congeners are what determine the taste/smell of the whisky. The abundance/concentration of various individual congeners is what separates Lagavulin from Laphroaig and more broadly, what separates different kinds of whisk(e)ys.

Lets say you have a well equipped anal chem lab and unlimited time/money. You acquire a bottle of Lagavulin just before its casked, analyze it and then 16y later obtain a bottle from the same cask for comparison. Are modern spectrometry and other analytical techniques advanced enough to confidently identify the precise composition/identity of congeners present in each bottle?

If so, is it possible to isolate (or alternatively, synthesize) the individual congeners in the mature bottle and then add them to the pre-cask whisky (at the measured concentrations) to ""instantly"" mature it? Or is the chemistry during maturation too complex to define and/or reproduce accurately?

Or better yet, as a pipe dream develop a lyophilized ""congener concentrate""  (ideally one free of histamine and other biogenic amines) that one could reconstitute with ethanol+water.

Obviously the cost effectiveness in either case would be questionable. But if you had best proc dev team on earth and could consistently isolate/reconstitute the congeners at large scales, I'd wager it could reap huge profits over the long term.",askscience

In the book, the main character meets an alien, named Rocky, who lives on a planet with such a thick atmosphere that light can't reach the ground. The characters talk with each other about their biology at length in order to learn about one another, and they talk a lot about sleep, too. Rocky has a weird sleep cycle and lives on a planet that also spins very fast. His sleep cycle does not seem to match his planet's day-night cycle. 

This got me wondering about Earth life. From what I understand, all animals sleep, it's almost a biological mandate. Even though some are nocturnal, it seems that sleep cycles are still, somewhat, in tune with the rotation of the Earth. Sunlight would be the main indicator for the body for any creature that can see daylight. 

But what about animals that live in total darkness, like in caves or deep in the ocean? Do we know anything about their sleep patterns? If we do, do they somehow follow a day/night cycle?

I’ve searched far and wide and cannot seem to find any answers. They don’t appear to be the sand ridges of the Simpson desert, they look drastically different, some look like the first picture looks (I see many of these when flying overhead) like off-road tracks/manmade clearing - however they certainly are not as they almost never link to a road, yet are clearly gaps in foliage
Are these survey lines? Mine suitability testing? Maybe even the remains of roads of a ghost town/telegraph line towns?

1855,190,1705697156.0,Why does singing while playing a flute creates a subharmonic?,"If you play a note of a certain frequency on a flute and simultaneously sing a note at a different frequency, then you create a third frequency that wouldn't be there if you play or sing in isolation - and the frequency of this subharmonic is the difference of the flute frequency and the voice frequency (I'm talking about the fundamental frequencies for simplicity). This is caused by modulation (product rule: cos(f1*x)cos(f2x) = 0.5*(cos(f1-f2)+cos(f1+f2)), which in turn suggests some nonlinearity in the system.

I made some observations about this effect:

1. It is not unique to flutes- works on any wind instrument (commonly known as Growling on saxophones)
2. It is NOT the Tartini tone / missing fundamental / difference tone. I know it might be tempting to classify it as such, but keep in mind that the Tartini tone is just in your head (caused by some nonlinearity in the hearing apparatus). The subharmonic mentioned here is clearly measurable on a spectrogram.
3. Whistling into the flute does not work. Sure, it produces a beat frequency (linear superposition) and a Tartini tone (illusion in your head), but the subharmonic is not visible on the spectrogram. This suggests to me that the nonlinearity that causes the modulation is somehow in the vocal chords. The problem might be somehow linked to coupled oscillators, but beyond me right now.

Do you have an intuitive explanation for this? Thanks!

Apparently, finished blood cells have to ""squeeze"" through semi-permeable tissue before they're allowed to enter the veins. I doubt this is accomplished through simple stochastic processes alone. Unfortunately, it's been difficult trying to figure out how this looks at a granular level, and I don't know where to begin.

Can we be cartain that everyone sees colors the same way? I'm not talking about colorblindness.

People usually reply with ,,we can't know"", or ,,there are slight diffrences"", but I want to know if we can reasonably assume that someone's blue might be another person's red.

I know it's technically possible, because we can't really check color interpretation differences between people, but this doesn't seem right to me. 

Could our brains really perceive colors so differently? I mean if you look at the color spectrum, blue and red are far apart. How would our brains come to such different results? Wouldn't everything have to be swapped around? 

The wavelength of red is around 700nm and the wavelength of blue is around 500nm. If some people saw red as blue, why would their brain jump from orange to blue without any colors in between?

Another thing is, wouldn't that result in a lot of people having color blindness? Chances of having colorblindness are quite low, especially if you have XX chromosomes.

We are leading the federal agency charged with setting and supporting the national agenda for mental health research. Ask us anything!,"Hi reddit! We are leading the federal agency charged with setting and supporting the national agenda for mental health research and are excited to talk with you today.

[Joshua A. Gordon, M.D., Ph.D.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director) is the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). He oversees an extensive research portfolio of basic and clinical research that seeks to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. Dr. Gordon pursued a combined M.D.-Ph.D. degree at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Medical school coursework in psychiatry and neuroscience convinced him that the greatest need, and greatest promise, for biomedical science was in these areas. Dr. Gordon's research focuses on the analysis of neural activity in mice carrying mutations of relevance to psychiatric disease. His lab studied genetic models of these diseases from an integrative neuroscience perspective, focused on understanding how a given disease mutation leads to a behavioral phenotype across multiple levels of analysis. To this end, he employs a range of systems neuroscience techniques, including in vivo imaging, anesthetized and awake behavioral recordings, and optogenetics, which is the use of light to control neural activity. His research has direct relevance to schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and depression. [Follow Dr. Gordon on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/NIMHDirector).



[Shelli Avenevoli, Ph.D.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/od/about-nimh-deputy-director-shelli-avenevoli-phd), is the Deputy Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). In 2001, Dr. Avenevoli joined the NIMH intramural research program as a staff scientist in the Section of Developmental Genetic Epidemiology of the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. In 2005, she moved to the NIMH division of extramural research as Chief of the Emotion, Mood, and Depressive Disorders Program. In 2008, Dr. Avenevoli became Chief of the Developmental Trajectories of Mental Disorders Branch. She has been heavily involved in a number of key NIMH efforts, including revising NIMH's Strategic Plan, re-defining the Institute's approach to supporting research in neurodevelopment and bipolar disorder, and serving as a liaison to other agencies for special initiatives. Prior to joining NIMH, Dr. Avenevoli received her Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology from Temple University, and completed an NIMH-funded postdoctoral fellowship in psychiatric epidemiology at Yale University School of Medicine.

1. What things does iron do in the body, and how does it do them?
2. What is it about iron that makes it able to do these things? Could another kind of metal do the same thing, or does it *have* to be iron? Maybe another kind of ferromagnetic metal?

1963,298,1704136524.0,How Do Gravitational Waves Affect A Human Body?,"Hello, folks!

I have two quick questions about gravitational waves. Let me say up top, I realize that there's not much we know about them, so I'm perfectly satisfied with 'best guess' answers here. Obviously if there *is* a known correct answer, that's best, but if not, an answer that seems to logically make sense given what we *do* know will work fine!

Now, for the questions!

1. Do gravitational waves diminish over time? Or, rather, do the distortions they cause diminish over time (and space)? Do they start to fade like a ripple in a pond, or do they maintain their level of distorting spacetime as they expand?
2. What is your best guess for how a strong gravitational wave might affect a human body? Would it just kinda pass through a person without being noticed, since it's distorting spacetime and the person is inside spacetime? Or would you feel it, kinda like a pressure wave? Would its effects likely be more macro or micro in scope? What would be your best guess as to how this would affect a human body - or, what might you compare it to? Any medical conditions you might compare it to?

Again, I realize that there's probably very little information to go on, so if we have to resort to conjecture, I'm comfortable with that, but I'd like to base our conjecture on as reasonable information and/or assumptions as possible. So! What do you all think?",askscience

1965,300,1704059552.0,How do combinations of food impact the bioavailability of each other?,"Question is in the subject line above. For a more extended backstory behind this question:

This question arises from some research I've been doing on pet food safety. There is a prominent theory that legumes/pulses (like peas, lentils, chickpeas) impact food absorption or body mechanisms in a way that causes diet-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) aka enlargening of the heart chamber in dogs and maybe cats (this started from widespread reports to the FDA about grain-free diets and non-genetic DCM cases which led to the FDA issuing an alert and investigation into this issue).

Apparently in the pet food industry, only less than a handful of brands are ever vet-recommended mainly because their ingredients and the interactions of those ingredients in those forms have been researched front and back on safety. Namely corn. 

So apparently, when mixed with meat products, corn is harmless, but legumes might be causing severe heart problems. Why is that? I know there isn't enough research on this specifically, but in a broader sense and theoretical aspect, how can food combinations do this?",askscience

1967,302,1704000633.0,Can dogs sense magnetic fields?,"Sorry this question is a bit weird. We have a border collie who has so far chewed:

1. A wire on an automatic gate
2. A wire on a pump/water feature
3. The brakes wire on our caravan

But here’s the odd thing. She isn’t much of a chewer, and she stops chewing the wire after it’s disconnected. The pump wire has been severed months ago. The wires are still hanging, if they were fun to play with before, they’re still fun to play with now. Only difference is now there’s no current flowing, so no magnetic field. And she stopped chewing it.

Idk if this helps but I think all of the wires she bit were DC (connected to battery for the van and solar for the gate and pump). So a static magnetic field, same as Earth’s field, although sharks, for example, can still use it to navigate.

All of the sources online are a bit sus, but there’s a lot that claim that dogs can detect magnetic fields, so I was wondering if anyone here had thoughts on whether my dog can detect magnetic fields or if it was just a coincidence.",askscience

We have either no idea why they happen (and in some cases not even the mechanism behind the symptoms). Or at most, a host of theories and maybe some knowledge about (potentially) involved genes (but even then, only theories, if at all, as to what actually triggers the onset).

Between evaporation and precipitation it seems like this amount is kept largely in equilibrium but, during the last glacial maximum, a lot of this precipitation would have frozen to form glaciers. 

Since that precipitation didn't make it into the ocean it stands to reason that this would have increased the salinity of the oceans. And sure, if the amount of water held in the glaciers was a drop in the bucket compared to the water in the oceans then I guess it wouldn't have made much of a difference.

But, [according to USGS][3]: ""global sea level was about 125 meters below today’s sea level at the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago"". 

This kinda makes me wonder: how saline were the oceans during the last glacial maximum?

Joining us are Lucas Eastham, M.S., Priera Panescu, Ph.D., and Bryan Quoc Le, Ph.D., who are here to answer all your questions about upcycling agricultural ""leftovers"" for the production of alternative proteins.

**Upcycling sidestreams is a critical step toward creating circular bioeconomies that produce food more efficiently, affordably, and sustainably.** The [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org/) (GFI), a nonprofit think tank working to make the global food system better for the planet, people, and animals, recently released a new report, ""[Cultivating alternative proteins from commodity crop sidestreams](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/)."" Find the GFI Sidestreams analysis report [here](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/) and webinar [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5HMeQzRU34).

The report identifies sidestreams (""leftovers"") that have tremendous potential to maximize food production via alternative proteins, while also reducing the costs and environmental impacts of agricultural waste. Specifically, this analysis identifies the optimal sidestreams candidates from North America's top crops that could be valorized for (1) protein concentrates for plant-based food ingredients, (2) protein hydrolysates for fermentation or cultivated meat media, and (3) lignocellulosic sugars for fermentation media.

This analysis highlights the major challenges associated with bringing these sidestreams into commercial use for the food industry. It also outlines strategic geographic opportunity areas and the need for public-private partnerships to fully exploit the economic and environmental potential sidestreams offer. Ultimately, the report aims to provide a landscape and actionable insights that commercial, non-profit, and public sector stakeholders can use to direct their efforts in building a sustainable, circular bioeconomy in the food industry.

[Lucas Eastham](https://gfi.org/team/lucas-eastham/) (/u/lucase-GFI) is a Senior Fermentation Scientist at The Good Food Institute, and previously worked for 10 years in microbial biotechnology bioprocess development for biofuels, biofertilizers, food ingredients, and cosmetic ingredients.

[Dr. Priera Panescu](https://gfi.org/team/priera-panescu/) (/u/Chemical_Preaction) is a Lead Scientist at The Good Food Institute. She is focused on analyzing plant-based meat and proteins, and how to expedite their progress. Prior to GFI, she spent nearly a decade working on polymer, formulation, and materials chemistry research.

2049,384,1702314188.0,"Could a system exist such that the vibration of its molecules due to heat, spontaneously synchronize?","So spontaneous synchronization is the idea that multiple oscillators that are physically connected in some way, can spontaneously synchronize their oscillations. 

My question is, is it possible to construct some system such that the random vibrations of molecules due to their thermal energy could spontaneously synchronize?  Could macroscopic movement arise from these microscopic thermal vibrations?

It feels like what I'm suggesting would violate the second law of thermodynamics,  but im not entirely sure about that.  As spontaneous synchronization of any oscillators also feels like it'd violate this law yet it obviously is real.

Perhaps it is possible, but only for sufficiently small systems?  I recall from a statistical mechanics class i took years ago that certain weird phenomena were actually possible for sufficiently small systems (such as a decrease in entropy for a small collection of particles, as the more orderly microstates were far more likely simply due to the number of permutations being much smaller)

2050,385,1702143527.0,Do longer trains always take longer to stop?,"I was thinking about how trains stop, the engineer pulls a lever which releases air from the brakes, which makes the wheels slow down.

Intuitively longer trains take longer to stop because they have a lot more momentum, but obviously they also have more wheels and brakes. I'm guessing that a 100 car train will have the same ""brake to weight"" ratio as a 10 car train.

I read that the delay between the lever being pulled and the air being released toward the back of the train contribute to the braking distance. Before the last car even starts braking the train has already moved forward. 

But in a perfect system where all of the brakes are applied at the same time, would a train with 100 cars take longer to stop than one with 10 cars? Assuming each individual car has the same mass and braking force. After all if you had 100 semi trucks driving on a motorway and had them brake at the same time, they'd stop within the same distance as a single semi would. Is that the same for trains?",askscience

2081,416,1701613280.0,"How does a ""battery box"" work to help electret microphones?","Some background and then details on my specific case:

When people record live music, there's typically a few things they carry in their kit: 1) a microphone (in some cases a pair of electret mics), 2) a ""battery box"" which provides power to the mics and passes the signal through to a 3) recording device.  Most recording devices also have their own ""mic level"" power, but ""tapers"" highly recommend using a battery box and turning off the power from the recorder if possible.

&#x200B;

My questions are: what does a battery box do and is it really important in my setup described below?  Is there anything I can do to improve my design, like using different resistors - i.e., would 3-6K resistors (or even lower) be better?

In my case, I'm making my own ""battery box"" using info available online.  It basically has [this](https://i.imgur.com/SUswVO6.jpg) layout.  I am using a 12v (21/23) battery and 9.1K resistors, along with capacitors of sizes ranging from 22pF to 1uF (I've built several on the premise that the 22pF caps help provide bass roll-off, while the 1uF do not).  I kinda understand the purpose of the caps (at least in theory), but it's the resistors that I'm confused about, and ultimately how important the battery box is in this setup.

When measuring the inherent ""mic level"" output of my recorder (a Roland R-07), I see 2v and what looks like \~0.015ma.  This would directly feed the mics in the absence of a battery box.

With the battery box (12v battery + 9.1K resistors), I see 12v and \~0.10ma.

The electret mics I'm using typically have 2.2K impedance, require 1-10V, and use ~0.5mA max current.  A schematic of one set of mics I'm using is found [here](https://i.imgur.com/aibNo3C.jpg).  I've tried some prototypes of both the mics and the battery box out, and the recordings sound fine when recording volumes loud enough to require ear plugs - no clipping or anything, but I wonder what the resistors are doing and if the 9.1K ones I've chosen are the best for this application.

E: corrected some values.

The curve in an absorbance spectra, as opposed a straight line at an exact frequency, can be explained by the doppler effect. If light is absorbed in an orbital at X frequency and you shoot light with a frequency of 0.95 X at the orbital, if the molecule is moving towards the light source at a certain speed, the doppler effect will increase the effective frequency to X from the perspective. Works similarly if you shoot light with a frequency of 1.05 X and the molecule is moving away.

There's uncertainty in every measurement. When you measure a liter of water, you can say a liter, or be more precise, say 1.0 liters, and then 1.02 liters, 1.018 liters, etc. You can always get more and more precise.

My hypothesis is that a car with all other factors the same including air density on a level plane will accelerate faster in slightly higher G environments than in slightly lower G environments. This hypothesis assumes that traction is a limiting factor of acceleration for this vehicle.

My reason for this hypothesis is that in higher G environments weight and therefore traction would increase but mass would remain unchanged. This would prevent the vehicle from spinning it's wheels off the line resulting in faster acceleration times than a lower G vehicle and since mass is unchanged it would have negligible impact on horizontal acceleration. They argue that since the vehicle would have more weight (not mass) it would be substantially slower.

Bloomberg did an investigative documentary on cancer-linked ""forever chemicals."" Ask us anything.","Hi Reddit! This is Tiffany from Bloomberg and I am joined by Dr. Philippe Grandjean of Southern Denmark University here. In a new documentary, I interviewed Dr. Grandjean on how substances known as PFAS, or ""forever chemicals,"" found their way to every corner of the planet-and the consequences.

You can watch it here: https://youtu.be/t8qGtEVh7oQ?si=QNjv4-IorQrCtpL4

PFAS are used in hundreds of everyday products-from fabric protectors, electronics and non-stick pans to foams, tapes and even toilet paper. PFAS are called ""forever chemicals"" because the properties that make them so useful to consumers make them very persistent in the environment.

In the Bloomberg Originals video documentary The Poison In Us All, we reveal how the chemicals - which have been linked to cancer and are the subject of sweeping litigation - ended up inside the bodies of almost everyone on the planet.

Litigation has revealed documents showing that its manufacturers, including industrial giant 3M, had dumped the chemicals for years and have been aware of the dangers associated with PFAS. 3M has said its products ""are safe and effective for their intended uses"" and assailed plaintiffs' lawyers for selectively citing documents to portray ""an incomplete and misleading story about 3M's actions.""

We'll be on at **1pm ET (18 UT)**, ask me and Dr. Grandjean any questions you have about PFAS here!

Today most fertile lands (mollisols) are located in Canada and Eurasian prairies but as far as we know, these are not where Neolithic Revolution first took place.

So I've been watching deep sea documentary videos. And they say Challenger Deep is 12000 meters down and almost freezing. But the furthest down we've been able to drill is 11000 meters, and as far as I understand it, the heat was the biggest obstacle preventing going further. Plus unless I'm just misunderstanding everything, shouldn't higher pressures increase temperature? 

So how is the deepest depths not hotter than a couple degrees? My first thought was the hot water would rise and cooler water would come down to take it's place, but that would cause like constant sideways tornadoes of water. So I searched if vertical currents were a thing. I found upwellings and downwellings. But most of what I could find was related to shallower water nearer the coast.

What’s happening on a molecular level? I don’t do well with abstract thought so I’ll provide an “experiment” and hopefully someone clever can explain it to me.

My questions are numbered but you don’t have to answer them directly like this, it just makes it easier for me:

1. If I put the beans under a super strong microscope that could show me the molecules (or whatever level we’d have to be observing to see what we want to see) while they were still hot/cold, how could I recognize by observation alone which one was hot and which one was cold?

2. What would the molecules in each bean do as it cooled/warmed up, respectively?

3. If the beans on the plate existed in a small vacuum universe, just big enough for the beans and a few cubic inches of air around them, how would their respective temperatures effect each other or the air as their temperature equalized? Would you be able to see the air around the hot bean heat up as the hot bean itself cools down, and what would that look like?

4. What causes temperature to equalize (why do hot things cool down, why do cold things warm up?)

I'm wondering how this impacts the exange of oxygen to yeast in the mixture? What passes along the 'skin' of a bubble? Is it a static structure until it pops or do sugar and water molecules flow along the surface? And if those things do flow, do yeast cells travel along the surface? 

Side notes for those interested. After the yeast peaks in activity it will move to an air locked environment to encourage alcohol production and give time for the yeast to break down the fructose, which takes longer. The source of my knowledge is coming from The Art of Fermentation by Sandor Ellix Katz. This isn't the first time following this method and harmful contamination risks are pretty low and very detectable.

This is also a small, hobby amount and the question is really a curiosity about the structure of bubbles. Don't really care about making perfect mead or I'd post this question elsewhere.",askscience

In high school chemistry we are given the knowledge and run on the assumption that electrons are solid objects orbiting various levels of energy from the nucleus, and things like donating electrons in ionic bonding and covalent bonding is the sharing of valence electrons to allow both atoms to reach the maximum number of electrons in a certain shell.

Once I got to slightly more advanced physics and understood the wave-particle behavior of electrons, I cannot make the link between how the bonding works when the concept of an electron can now be described as a field. Does it just bypass this entire concept together, only interacting as the particle section of the wave-particle duality?

For context I was thinking about lightspeed and how its impossible to go faster than it but I got this idea into my head and I can't get it out.

Imagine a Seesaw floating in outer space, the ""plank"" is perfectly rigid and the plank its 2 lightseconds long. If I were to push down on one end of the seesaw, would the other end go up 2 seconds later or would it start moving at the same time? (asuming that the center doesnt move down when you push it down).  Also, what would happen if I just push the whole seesaw from the center down, would ends of it go down at the same time or would they go down a second later?

I understand that seasons are caused by the tilt of the earth causing the North hemisphere to receive more sunlight than the south hemisphere for half a year and vice versa. Would it be possible for a planet to orbit a star in a way that the axis is always leaning towards the sun? I believe this would mean that the planet is orbiting around one axis (such as north and south poles) as well as another axis perpendicular to the plane of the orbit allowing the north pole to always be angled towards the sun. Would the axis of the north and south poles have to intersect with the star for this to be achieved, or could the angle of the axis be angled above or below the star?

here's my issue: arent the electrons in the atomic structure standing waves? as in, they are not propagating, so there is no relative velocity between them and the frame of reference (the nucleus).

my understanding is that the electrons can't be moving because if they were then they'd be radiating due to moving through the nucleus' E-field, which they aren't. not to mention if they ARE in motion then they're also all moving relative to each other's E-field in a multi-e system.

**[Gerald (Jerry) Wilkinson](https://biology.umd.edu/people/gerald-wilkinson)** is a professor in the University of Maryland Department of Biology who conducts research on social behavior, with emphasis on how genetic mechanisms may influence the outcome of evolution. He has studied several species of bats, including vampire bats, in the Neotropics and the US to understand cooperative behavior and communication. Recently, his lab has used DNA methylation to predict age in bats and discovered that extreme longevity, which has evolved in multiple bat lineages, is associated with changes in methylation near genes involved in immunity. Current projects aim to identify epigenetic changes associated with social stress, immune function, and sex differences in aging in bats.

**Katherine Armenta** is a third-year Ph.D. student in the University of Maryland Behavior, Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics program (BEES). She is studying one of the most abundant bat species in Maryland, Eptesicus fuscus, or the big brown bat, and its communication and social behavior within and across species.

**Danielle Adams** is a postdoc in the Wilkinson Lab at the University of Maryland. She is studying the interactions between stress, aging, and immunity in wild bats. During her Ph.D. (UMD '19), she studied sexual selection in phyllostomid bats, a diverse family of leaf-nosed bat species found in the Neotropics. Prior to studying bats, Danielle studied vocal communication and the use of imitation in wild parrots. She also holds a master's in conservation biology (Columbia University '10).

The trend is clear - more modern methods of wireless communication use higher frequency waves, with less range.

Am I correct in assuming this is because at high frequencies, even if you only occupy a small portion of the frequency you still got a huge bandwidth? And using the traditional Long Wave, Medium Wave and Short Wave frequencies, just how good of a bitrate could be achieved if instead of transmitting sound a digital mode using all advances in modern technology (most modern modulation etc.) are used?

2305,640,1697762036.0,Why were lines of longitude defined differently from lines of latitude? (ie not parallel),"I understand that lines of longitude converge at the poles, but why were they made to do that when lines of latitude run parallel to each other? 

Or maybe what I want to know is, why don’t we have another set of lines that run north and south but remain parallel to each other? 

I think I can understand why you don’t need converging lines that run east to west, but if parallel lines are helpful running east and west, wouldn’t they be helpful running north and south too?

Edit: Apologies that this is so unclear, it was very hard to find the wording to convey my question. Maybe what I should have asked is, why is it helpful to  measure latitudinally using nearly cylindrical parallel divisions, where we measure the earth longitudinally in converging divisions that make a shape like an orange carpel (again, I am running out of words here).

Second Edit: CrustalTrudger helped me understand that the lines of longitude and latitude were defined as they were primarily because of their relation to the sun and the poles and their usefulness in navigation. The lines of longitude are not just measuring the difference between places on the earth, but  instead are something like tracking the places which are directly under the sun at the same time. This would have been more practical at the time than covering the globe in a grid of arbitrary parallel lines. The latitudinal lines are even distances from the equator which has significance in relation to both the sun and the poles.",askscience
2306,641,1697740825.0,Doesn't this violate the equivalence principle?,"I'm sorry if this has been asked before, I searched on Reddit and Google and could not find this question asked.

If two stationary balls are in a box which has a complete vacuum in deep space, ignoring the gravity of the balls for each other, the balls will just sit in the same spots forever.

However if the balls in the vacuum in the box were freefalling in an orbit around the earth, because the balls independently have elliptical orbits around the earth, they should move towards each other and then away from each other, oscillating back and forth.

Wouldn't this distinguish the first and second scenarios and thus violate Einstein's Equivalence principle? Thanks.

2310,645,1697732457.0,How would we know if we were moving at near light speeds?,"If I am walking 5km/h in a train that is moving 100km/h I'm really moving 105km/h relative to the earth. But the earth is moving 107,000 km/h relative to the sun so in a way I'm moving 107105km/h. But our solar system is moving 200,000km/s through the milky way so add that also... etc, etc etc.  
Now I realize that the speed of light is the fastest anything can move. And I know that time changes depending on the speed you are going. But I have also been led to believe that the object that is moving at great speed is experiencing time slower than those moving slower, yet to the object itself time still seems to move the same while the outside world form its perspective seems to speed up.

  
1. Since speed is relative and there is no fixed point to use as a speed of zero, if a planet was already moving at near light speed relative to another point in space how would its inhabitants even know that they were moving that fast?

  
2. If I, along with my world, was already moving this fast would my interpretation of light speed still just be an additional 300,000km/s relative to me?

Some of those planets are speculated to have ocean-like liquids. Now that's just a scientist's guess when they gather info about the exoplanet, but like with Coral reefs being visible from space, can the same be possible from, let's say footages of these planets? Like, zooming on the footage and observing the oceans from there?

However, I'm aware that if those planets had something similar like Coral reefs here, we could identify alien life already. To simplify the question, if we find an alien planet with oceans, would it be likely that we could find some visible life activity from space footage, similar to coral reefs on Earth?

Learning that trans genus trans family and sometimes trans order hybrids were possible blew my mind, and left me with difficult questions about how and why we classify animals.

By that definition, isn't the protoplasm just the cell? at least in a cell without a cell wall that description includes every single part of a cell, so what's even the point of the word protoplasm?

Initially, the particle seems sensible - it's a packet of waves that behaves like a particle in the aggregate. But once it starts scattering, nothing makes sense to me anymore.

1. It is my understanding that particles are discrete - you can't have half a photon. But in this simulation, the scattering pushes half of it through the lattice and half reflects backwards!

2. Scattering seems to disperse the energy of the particle over a large (and infinitely expanding) area of space. Is the particle destroyed after this? I didn't think particles could be destroyed. 

3. What would happen if you observed this particle after the scattering? Would all these waves collapse into a single discrete particle again? How does this process work?",askscience
