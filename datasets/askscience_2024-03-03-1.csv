2,1591120666.0,Black Lives Matter,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.

3,1686543618.0,AskScience’s concerns regarding Reddit’s API changes,"In April 2023, [Reddit announced they would begin charging for its application programming interface (API)
access](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/technology/reddit-ai-openai-google.html).

API is used to allow different applications to interact with each other. We are a heavily moderated subreddit, and we use API access for moderation, AMA organisation, and insights into our community. We are using community-driven tools which use the API in order to make management of a community as large as /r/askscience practical for our group of volunteer moderators.

At the same time, we recognise both Reddit's mission as a corporation, as well as the dangers and risks arising from access to the API. Reddit is looking for ways to [monetize its user-generated content](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/upcoming-reddit-blackout-and-future-third-party-applications); the Times article linked above notes has been used to train high-profile machine learning models like OpenAI's.

While Reddit administration has mentioned [free access for moderation tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/), we believe their current approach of gatekeeping access based on arbitrary and indiscriminate rate limiting has several shortcomings:  
It disproportionately impacts people who use Reddit with accommodations, such as screen readers: Reddit has stated that [accessibility-focused apps will be exempt from the new restrictions](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/reddit-makes-an-exception-for-accessibility-apps-under-new-api-terms/) but has offered little clarity on what that means for this rapidly-approaching change  
It does not reflect Reddit’s promise to [support moderation
  tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/)  
It does not establish clear and concise criteria for what is legitimate API usage  

We also remain cognisant of Reddit’s past promises to [improve communication with
moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/) and build tools for us to improve search and combat hateful rhetoric, anti-vaccination, and COVID denialism. While Reddit has banned hate speech and banned communities spreading science denialism, we feel they have not delivered on moderation tools and support. We feel that 3rd-party tools still offer superior support for moderation as well as accessibility features.

Everyone in the /r/askscience community contributes to its quality and longevity by volunteering their time and expertise to question, answer, and moderate scientific discussion. We feel the Reddit administration does a disservice our passion for large-scale, high-quality science communication by [pursuing a unilateral and opaque
direction](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/). This damages our community and ultimately Reddit itself by severing the trust we place upon it as a platform for science education and outreach.

One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place.

Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

An educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education.

FAQ:

> Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

> Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

90,1591659316.0,Why do we hear about breakthroughs in cancer treatment only to never see them again?,"
I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

1. There is a scene in which a character touches someone who has been affected by nuclear radiation with their hand. When they pull their hand away, their palm and fingers have already begun to turn red with radiation sickness.

2. There is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness. A nurse discovers her and freaks out and kicks her out of the hospital for her own safety.

**Is actual radiation contamination *that* contagious?** [This article](https://www.livescience.com/13444-radiation-exposure-contagious.html) seems to indicate that it's nearly impossible to deliver radiation via skin-to-skin contact, and that as long as a sick person washes their skin and clothes, they're safe to be around, even if they've inhaled or ingested radioactive material that is still in their bodies.

****

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.

First of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, ""Tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""Tawat 'ankhu qaman"" ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).

* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point.

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) — a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration — was designed to capture images of a black hole. Today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, EHT researchers have revealed that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.

The image reveals the black hole at the centre of Messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. This black hole resides 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun

- Press conference right now! [eso.org/live](https://www.eso.org/live/).

163,1594554670.0,"The Human Genome Project cost $2.7 billion. 20 years later, it costs <$1000 to sequence the genome. Was the cost of the project fundamentally necessary for subsequent progress, or could we have ""waited"" for the technology to become cheaper?","I'm very much a clueless layman, but I'm learning about genetics for the first time. I don't mean this in any sort of combative way–the Human Genome Project had countless benefits that we can't possibly track, and I'd imagine $2.7 billion is a trifle compared to its broader impact. 

My question is just narrowly about the way that genome sequencing has dropped rapidly in cost. Was it fundamentally necessary to first use these exorbitantly pricey methods, which provided the foundation for the future research which would make it affordable? Or are the two questions inherently separate: the Human Genome Project gave us a first, initial glimpse at our mapped out genome, and then a decade later separate technological developments would make that same task much cheaper (as is commonly the case in science and technology).

The ""could we have waited"" in the title is probably misleading–I really don't mean any sort of  value judgment (the project sounds enormously important), I purely mean ""could"" in a narrow hypothetical (not, ""would it have been a good idea to wait"", which I highly doubt).",askscience

*Summary:* We are a team of astronomers running a campaign called the Pale Red Dot. We have found definitive evidence of a planet in orbit around the closest star to Earth, besides the Sun. The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System. 

Our results have just been published today in Nature, but our observing campaign lasted from mid January to April 2016. We have kept a blog about the entire process here: [www.palereddot.org](http://www.palereddot.org/) and have also communicated via Twitter @Pale_Red_Dot and Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/](https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/)

394,1600254051.0,AskScience AMA Series: We have hints of life on Venus. Ask Us Anything!,"An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial ""aerial"" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.

Signs of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.

Details on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2015/

We are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery. We will be available on Wednesday, 16 September, starting with 16:00 UTC, 18:00 CEST (Central European Summer Time), 12:00 EDT (Eastern Daylight Time). Ask Us Anything!

416,1494160962.0,"If iron loses its magnetism at around 1400°F, how is the earths core magnetic?","After reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system I saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism).

Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.

Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.

So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.

Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.

So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.

Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?

Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.

The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.

More information on the scientists conducting the research can be found [here](https://www.jcu.edu.au/news/releases/2017/march/fnq-search-for-the-tasmanian-tiger) in a media release from James Cook University. Dr. Sandra Abell and professor Bill Laurence will be leading a team of scientists that will be placing 50 wildlife cameras out in strategic locations to try to catch a glimpse of the creature.

462,1539616254.0,Prosthetics: Can someone born without a limb (rather than losing it after birth) use advanced prosthetics controlled by nerves and neural pathways?,"I understand (or at least, I think I do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.  Let's say instead, however, that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defect/genetic condition.  At no point have they had an elbow, or forearm, hand... If he are she is born this way I presume that there is no neural pathways/nerves to dock onto.  I am sure that technology will continue to advance so I guess I am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.

The inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  He utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  A very heart warming video.  Many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.

They represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.

I made a drawing to make my question clearer : [Drawing](http://imgur.com/a/C84eq)

 *The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.*

 *The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.*

 * The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited

 * On the second line of the ""comic"" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !

 * On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?


**To recap**

It sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?

563,1513782408.0,Has there ever been evidence of spatial dimensions beyond the three we can perceive?,"Lately I've become extremely interested in spatial dimensions beyond length, width, and height, reading Flatland, etc.

I was thinking about something recently. If we have a universe of 2D space that us as three-dimensional beings can look at, we can interact with that universe but only in a distorted kind of sense. A 3D object casts a 2D shadow. A 3D object moving through the plane of a 2D universe would appear to a 2D being as something that appears from nowhere, changes shape, and eventually disappears into nothingness.

We haven't found a 2D plane of existence to test this out on, of course, and, as far as I know, We haven't ever seen a four-dimensional object cast a three-dimensional ""Shadow."" At least, as far as I know.

I've seen some people postulate about 5, 6, even 10 spatial dimensions. But if these dimensions actually existed, shouldn't we have seen, by now, some form of evidence of them? Or have we seen three-dimensional ""shadows"" of four-dimensional objects and I'm just unaware?",askscience

575,1560248895.0,Is there any record of any object from earth being ejected to space by natural forces?,"I have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations: 

**1. The Moon**

>u/Chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the Earth, in the form of our moon. Simulations (e.g. [Canup & Asphaug 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35089010.pdf), [Cuk & Stewart 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1047/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. [Wiechert et al., 2001](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly Mars-sized) object collided with the proto-Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-Mantle and proto-Crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.

 **2. A Moon rock which is actually an Earth meteorite**

> u/yellowstone10: Some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a Moon rock collected by the crew of Apollo 14 was probably ejected from the Earth about 4 billion years ago. [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  
>  
>u/foramsgalorams: In January of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from Apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from Earth within it! This would make it an Earth meteorite which struck the Moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. This would have happened like a game of Solar System pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking Earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the Moon. Radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in Earth’s 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the Theia-Earth impact event which formed the Moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. You can read more on the details [here](https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19300202). 

**3. Moldavite – Rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**

> u/aa_unfiltered: Moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. It formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in Germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. [https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite](https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) 

**4. Hydrogen and Helium** 

>u/SlowerThanLightSpeed: ""Jean's escape"" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\_escape#Jeans\_Escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_Escape)   
>  
>Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\[10\] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\[10\] but a Japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth.\[11\] 

**Also Volcanoes apparently DO NOT have enough force to eject matter into space** 

>u/Clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a ""supervolcano"" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. Most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - [http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) 
>
>u/KnowanUKnow : It's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. The most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. Subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. Not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. I thought Krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of TNT. But even that isn't enough. It literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 Hiroshimas (or 4 Tsar Bombs) and even that isn't enough. There's something called a Verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a Verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed.

TIL: the iconic ""dive-bomber diving"" sound we all know is actually the sound of a [WWII German Ju87 Stuka Dive Bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87). It was the sound of a siren placed on the plane's gear legs and was meant to instil fear and hopefully make the enemy scatter instead of shooting back.

626,1647860461.0,"AskScience AMA Series: We've discovered that pancreatic cancer is detectable based on microbes in stool, with the potential for earlier screening in the future. AUA!","Hi Reddit! We are Ece Kartal (u/psecekartal), Sebastian Schmidt (u/TSBSchm) and Esther Molina-Montes (u/memmontes). We are lead authors on a recently published study showing that non-invasive (and early) detection of pancreatic cancer may be possible using stool samples. Ask Us Anything!

Pancreatic cancer is a horrible disease: although few people develop this form of cancer, only around 1 in 20 patients survive for 5 years or longer after diagnosis. This is in part due to late detection: symptoms are unspecific and often occur only when the disease has already progressed to advanced stages, so that diagnosis if often too late for therapeutic intervention (surgery and/or chemotherapy). This makes the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer an important goal in mitigating the disease, yet no approved non-invasive or minimally invasive, inexpensive tests currently exist.

We studied a Spanish population of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, the most common form of pancreatic cancer) and clinically matched controls that were either pancreas-healthy or suffered from chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas, an important risk factor for the development for PDAC). We found that a set of 27 microbial species detected in feces provide a very specific signature for PDAC patients, even in early stages. When combined with a blood serum-based cancer progression (not diagnostic) marker, prediction accuracy increased even further. We confirmed this finding in an independent German cohort, and also made sure that this microbiome signature did not falsely predict PDAC among thousands of subjects that were either healthy or suffered from other diseases. Moreover, we were able to trace some of these signature microbes between mouth, pancreatic healthy tissue, pancreatic tumors, and the gut which suggests that they may be more than just indicators.

Our study is freely available online in the journal GUT (Kartal, Schmidt, Molina-Montes, et al; 2022): https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/01/26/gutjnl-2021-324755

A commentary by R. Newsome and C. Jobin in the same issue puts our work into context: https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/02/21/gutjnl-2021-326710

For less formal introductions, check the press releases by one of our funding bodies ([Worldwide Cancer Research](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/news-opinion/2022/march/microorganisms-in-stool-samples-could-offer-new-way-to-detect-pancreatic-cancer-early/)) or the lead institutions [EMBL Heidelberg, Germany](https://www.embl.org/news/science/an-international-study-proposes-stool-analysis-for-early-detection-of-pancreatic-cancer/) and [CNIO Madrid, Spain (text in Spanish)]( https://www.cnio.es/noticias/una-colaboracion-internacional-propone-un-analisis-de-heces-para-la-deteccion-temprana-del-cancer-de-pancreas/).

Our work is an early proof of principle and will need to be further validated on larger and independent cohorts. Yet our findings hold some promise for a future inexpensive, non-invasive screening method for pancreatic cancer. Such a screen could initially target risk groups, e.g. above a certain age or with a family history of PDAC. Ideally, with further development and in combination with other biomarkers, our approach might be developed into an actionable diagnosis method in the future. That said, none of us is a medical doctor; we cannot and will not provide any medical advice, and none of what we post here should be construed as such.

We will be on at Noon Eastern (16 UT), and are looking forward to your questions, AUA!

**Edit:** So far in this thread, we have two points being made on the usefullness of the masks: 

1. They prevent hand to mouth/nose touching. 

2. They prevent saliva, mucus/phlegm projection into someone's face, as well as receiving some from the projection of others in close quarters.

Sounds good to me. 

So yes, they are useful, but not as a definitive deterent for airborn disease.

* Other types of masks and filters may be used for air transmitted bacteria and viruses.

All the while I saw dozen of birds out flying around, in the few patches of river that hadn't frozen yet and flying in the air above. It was -20 give or take when I went out, and that's peanuts compared to what it was overnight, but these birds clearly survived that. How do they manage it?

This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from?

We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7uNbjg

My lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.

One of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. 

By producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.

I'm curious how programmed or predictable mosquito behaviors are. For example, does it actually have a behavior like ""if swatted at, lay low for 30 minutes before trying again?"" Or am I just imagining the correlation? Second, if they do have a ""hide"" behavior, do they choose predictable locations? Do they prefer corners of the room? Areas with less light (do they even use light in making their decisions)? Do they go low to the ground? High on the ceiling? Do they use air currents and calmness to choose a spot?

It seems like I usually find mosquitos hiding out in a shadowy corner near the floor of the room, which is infuriating because if it would just hang out in the open against the white, well-lit wall, it would be a lot easier to hunt them down. This correlation could definitely just be my own confirmation bias at play, though, so I'm curious if much is known on this topic.

EDIT: Thank you for the lovely replies so far! I just wanted to clarify that I'm not actually that interested in \*where\* mosquitos hide in a descriptive sense, I'm more interested in how and ""why"" they make their decisions... like which senses do they use most (vision, smell, touch), and do they actually have different phases like hunting vs. hiding, or are they just sort of always doing the same thing and flying around aimlessly until they detect prey, then go for an attack?

EDIT 2: Well this post blew up! You may notice that it's a bit of a comment graveyard... sorry but askscience has strict commenting policies and the mods had to remove most of the replies. The vast majority of replies were either 1) personal tips for hunting mosquitoes, or 2) personal anecdotes on where mosquitoes hide. 

Precisely one comment linked to an actual scientific research article (thank you /u/Hillsbottom!) showing that at the very least mosquitoes can learn to associate being swatted at with certain chemical odors, and then avoid the source of those odors (people) in the future.

I didn't feel satisfied so I spent a few hours trawling the literature... turns out there's simply no research on this topic! We know a great deal about mosquito hunting behavior and how it finds its target, but seemingly nothing on hiding behavior. It's not even clear whether there exists a ""hiding"" behavioral program, or if they're just sort of always on the hunt and are just updating their attraction/aversion biases in response to swats, etc. 

However, after reading up on it I do think it's safe to say that the majority of the hunting/hiding behaviors are instinctual and not learned. It turns out adult mosquitoes are only alive and hunting for \~2-4 days before they stop and spend several days digesting + laying eggs (they typically repeat this hunt/rest cycle \~3-4 times before they die). Furthermore, a mosquito can collect all the blood it needs in one meal if left undisturbed, so in reality it typically only feeds on 1-5 people before stopping. Therefore, even though to us it seems like mosquitoes are constantly present and attacking us, from a single mosquito's perspective it may only ever encounter a few humans (less than 10) in its life cycle, and over the course of only a few days. That isn't a lot of data for the mosquito to ""learn"" with. So, if the possible answers to my original question are 1) it's random, 2) they have instinct-driven preferences for hiding, with a lot of variation between regions/species, or 3) they learn where to hide from experience, we can probably rule out #3.

But do the different hazards actually affect firefighting practice, or do firefighters have a generic approach anyway?

UPDATE 19 June: Wow. Thanks for awesome answers everyone. I'll attempt to do a brief summary:

* It's not a major issue for putting out the initial fire. Water can still be used. A spray of individual droplets doesn't provide a conductive path.

* It *is* a concern for cutting people out of a crashed vehicle. Responders must be careful not to cut through energised high voltage wiring. But non-electric cars also have hazards to cutting such as airbags.

* It's a concern for removing and storing the wreck. Li-ion batteries can reignite after seemingly being extinguished and this can go on for days.

Thanks for all your questions. Find images, videos, and everything you need to know about our historic mission to unfold the universe: [jwst.nasa.gov](http://jwst.nasa.gov).**

-----

The James Webb Space Telescope (aka Webb) is the most complex, powerful and largest space telescope ever built, designed to fold up in its rocket before unfolding in space. After its scheduled Dec. 24, 2021, liftoff from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana (located in South America), Webb will embark on a 29-day journey to an orbit one million miles from Earth.

For two weeks, it will systematically deploy its sensitive instruments, heat shield, and iconic primary mirror. Hundreds of moving parts have to work perfectly - there are no second chances. Once the space telescope is ready for operations six months after launch, it will unfold the universe like we've never seen it before. With its infrared vision, JWST will be able to study the first stars, early galaxies, and even the atmospheres of planets outside of our own solar system. Thousands of people around the world have dedicated their careers to this endeavor, and some of us are here to answer your questions. We are:

+ Dr. Jane Rigby, NASA astrophysicist and Webb Operations Project Scientist (JR)
+ Dr. Alexandra Lockwood, Space Telescope Science Institute project scientist and Webb communications lead (AL)
+ Dr. Stephan Birkmann, European Space Agency scientist for Webb's NIRSpec camera (SB)
+ Karl Saad, Canadian Space Agency project manager (KS)

Did you know, for example, that some dogs can  learn words like human infants? Or some dogs can detect cancer? What makes dogs so successful at winning our hearts?
 
A bit more about me: I’m an associate professor at Duke University where I founded and direct the [Duke Canine Cognition Center](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/research/dogs), which is the first center in the U.S. dedicated to studying how dogs think and feel. Our work is being used to improve training techniques, inform ideas about canine cognitive health and identify the best service and bomb detecting dogs.  I helped reveal the love and bond mechanism between humans and dogs. Based on this research, I co-founded [Dognition](https://www.dognition.com), an online tool featuring fun, science-based games that anyone with a dog can use to better understand how their dog thinks compared to other dogs.

Gravity on the other hand, as I understand it, isn't something that's emitted like some kind of tractor beam, it's a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object. So, what I'm wondering is, is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect. Does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of it's gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat? Or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object, if very neglegable, even if it's a great distance away? And if so, does that gravity move at some kind of speed, and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one? Additional mass isn't being created in such an event, but is ""new gravity"" being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object?

I realize that it's entirely possible that my concept of gravity is way off so please correct me if that's the case. This is something that's always interested me but I could never wrap my head around.

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNe2Ae5a2c) of some bursting bubbles in slow-motion. Notice that the bursting edge recedes from the initiation point; the intact surface remains unaffected until the bursting edge reaches it.

For simplicity, assume a *perfect bubble*:

- Perfectly spherical
- Evenly distributed surface
- No external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium)
- ""Pop"" or burst initiated from a single point on the surface

It seems intuitive that the *upper limit* would be the **speed of sound** for whatever medium the bubble was made from, because the speed of sound would be the physical limit that the information could be passed along that the bubble was popping.

It may all just be confirmation bias, but I always feel that my phone battery drains insanely quickly during that last 15-20% while it doesn’t drain as quickly off a fresh charge. 

Lastly, I’ve always heard that battery technology was moving at a snail’s pace yet lately I’ve been hearing about phones charging to 50% in 20 mins. I’m assuming that the remaining 50% takes longer than 20 mins to charge, which is another reason I feel like each “percent” on my battery could last different amounts of time.",askscience

Am I missing something or is the difference so tiny we could never even measure it?

Edit: I am seeing a lot of people bring up drag and also say that the mass of the object cancels out when solving for the acceleration of the object. Let me add some assumptions to this question to get to what I’m really asking:
  
    1: Assume there is no drag
    2: By “fall faster” I mean the two object will meet quicker

It also usually happens in the middle of typing. It never happened, for me, on first letters I typed. And, I am sure my finger did not touch the screen in a way i just did not feel it. When it happened i was surely away from screen, that is why it always jumps out when it happens. It is always unexpected.

Edit2:
I can surely replicate phone registering very soft touches (without me feeling actually touching it) but those random ones I am experiencing are different, the finger is always a lot further away than when i can register a touch without feeling it by testing. A lot may be very relative term but that is how it feels to me, i am not really sure how far the finger actually is because it usually happens really fast and its hard to measure so small distances with feelings.
