       "2612  This question comes with baggage and is bases on some loose assumptions that may be true. When I ask why the French are considered white, I mean why are they considered white to the far right in countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It seems a common reason why for example the Irish or Polish were not considered white was because they were Catholic and thus co sidereal inferior. So why then are the French exempted and viewed widely as white despite being very catholic themselves? Perhaps this is based on a false premise that race and religion are connected in ways that they are not, but I can't see why Irish immigrants wouldn't be seen as white otherwise (excluding the Ulster Irish, who were considered white because they were protestant). Obviously I am asking this moreso in reference to Germanic White supremacist in anglophone and Germanic countries , because I am sure the French do regard themselves as white. Does it have something to do with the franks?    \n",

These sources have also stated, however, that it is unclear whether or not these directly impact outbreaks. Furthermore, it is known that lots of people with herpes tend to never show any symptoms, while others may experience them highly frequently. Is there a definite correlation between these triggers and outbreaks, and can a person’s immune system or genetics play a role in their occurrences?   \n",

I've also heard of but never really studied the process of producing an animal in a lab with a single set of maternal DNA. It seems to me that for this to be done successfully whoever is producing this animal would need to find a way of reproducing methylation patterns that occur during spermatogenesis otherwise the resulting specimen would be unviable. I assume I am either grossly misinformed about how cloning animals work or am missing an important part about imprinting. Thanks for any help this question has been driving me crazy since I first heard about imprinting but don't feel compiled to invest the time it would take to figure it out myself.    \n",

       "2612  This question comes with baggage and is bases on some loose assumptions that may be true. When I ask why the French are considered white, I mean why are they considered white to the far right in countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It seems a common reason why for example the Irish or Polish were not considered white was because they were Catholic and thus co sidereal inferior. So why then are the French exempted and viewed widely as white despite being very catholic themselves? Perhaps this is based on a false premise that race and religion are connected in ways that they are not, but I can't see why Irish immigrants wouldn't be seen as white otherwise (excluding the Ulster Irish, who were considered white because they were protestant). Obviously I am asking this moreso in reference to Germanic White supremacist in anglophone and Germanic countries , because I am sure the French do regard themselves as white. Does it have something to do with the franks?    \n",

These sources have also stated, however, that it is unclear whether or not these directly impact outbreaks. Furthermore, it is known that lots of people with herpes tend to never show any symptoms, while others may experience them highly frequently. Is there a definite correlation between these triggers and outbreaks, and can a person’s immune system or genetics play a role in their occurrences?   \n",

I've also heard of but never really studied the process of producing an animal in a lab with a single set of maternal DNA. It seems to me that for this to be done successfully whoever is producing this animal would need to find a way of reproducing methylation patterns that occur during spermatogenesis otherwise the resulting specimen would be unviable. I assume I am either grossly misinformed about how cloning animals work or am missing an important part about imprinting.

       "2612  Why are the French considered \"white\"? This question comes with baggage and is bases on some loose assumptions that may be true. When I ask why the French are considered white, I mean why are they considered white to the far right in countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It seems a common reason why for example the Irish or Polish were not considered white was because they were Catholic and thus co sidereal inferior. So why then are the French exempted and viewed widely as white despite being very catholic themselves? Perhaps this is based on a false premise that race and religion are connected in ways that they are not, but I can't see why Irish immigrants wouldn't be seen as white otherwise (excluding the Ulster Irish, who were considered white because they were protestant). Obviously I am asking this moreso in reference to Germanic White supremacist in anglophone and Germanic countries , because I am sure the French do regard themselves as white. Does it have something to do with the franks?   \n",

After doing some reading I have heard that herpes viruses tend to break out in a person after a variety of triggers, such as stress, sun exposure, illness, hormonal changes etc…, and people can avoid outbreaks by avoiding these causes.  These sources have also stated, however, that it is unclear whether or not these directly impact outbreaks. Furthermore, it is known that lots of people with herpes tend to never show any symptoms, while others may experience them highly frequently. Is there a definite correlation between these triggers and outbreaks, and can a person’s immune system or genetics play a role in their occurrences?  \n",

It seems to me that for this to be done successfully whoever is producing this animal would need to find a way of reproducing methylation patterns that occur during spermatogenesis otherwise the resulting specimen would be unviable. I assume I am either grossly misinformed about how cloning animals work or am missing an important part about imprinting.
